00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:06.878
Baba...

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.255
<i>Yes, my son.</i>

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:09.836
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:12.089
<i>Which one?</i>

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.340
<i>The story of home.</i>

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.091
<i>Millions of years ago...</i>

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.851
<i>a meteorite
made of vibranium...</i>

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.353
<i>the strongest substance
in the universe...</i>

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.435
<i>struck the continent
of Africa...</i>

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.478
<i>affecting the plant life
around it.</i>

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.647
<i>And when
the time of man came...</i>

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:36.658
<i>five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.</i>

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.956
<i>The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...</i>

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.287
<i>until a warrior shaman...</i>

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.419
<i>received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...</i>

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.627
<i>who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...</i>

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.042
<i>a plant that granted him</i>

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:57.130
<i>superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.</i>

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.718
<i>The warrior became king...</i>

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.259
<i>and the first Black Panther...</i>

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:04.019
<i>the protector of Wakanda.</i>

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.022
<i>Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...</i>

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:11.527
<i>but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.</i>

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.314
<i>The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...</i>

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.735
<i>more advanced
than any other nation.</i>

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.573
<i>But as Wakanda thrived...</i>

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.160
<i>the world around it descended
further into chaos.</i>

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.544
<i>To keep vibranium safe...</i>

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:32.673
<i>the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...</i>

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.505
<i>keeping the truth
of their power</i>

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.587
<i>from the outside world.</i>

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.965
<i>And we still hide,</i> Baba?

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.016
<i>Yes.</i>

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:44.893
<i>Why?</i>

00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.106
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.615
Whatever!
Get outta here!

00:01:58.744 --> 00:01:59.744
Check up.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.990
Pick your man up! He open.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:04.200
Where you at?

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.160
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:07.496
Pass! Pass!

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:08.784
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.452
Watch me get this.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.422
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.508
Come on.

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:15.593
What you got?

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:16.677
You ain't got nothing.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.714
Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:19.805
won't be no worries.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.930
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.261
Come around the corner.

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:24.513
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.366
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.642
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.028
Hide the straps.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.362
Yo, is it the Feds?

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.365
No.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.297
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.007
They're holding spears.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.602
Open it.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.469
You serious?

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.180
They won't knock again.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.032
Who are you?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.247
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.463
Prove to me you are one of us.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.263
My King.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.267
Leave us.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:52.430
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:54.723
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:57.314
As you wish.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:58.602
At ease.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.165
Come, baby brother.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.174
Let me see
how you are holding up.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.214
You look strong.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.299
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.390
How is home?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.683
Not so good.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.644
Baby brother.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.294
There has been an attack.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.814
This man...

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.896
Ulysses Klaue...

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.317
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:44.732
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.527
Many lives were lost.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.906
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.619
and how to strike.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.710
He had someone on the inside.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:58.875
Why are you here?

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.340
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:05.424
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.214
I did no such thing.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.176
Tell him who you are.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.686
Zuri, son of Badu...

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:15.856
What?

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.067
James. James, you lied to me?

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.157
Leave him.

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.302
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.326
You betrayed Wakanda!

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.471
How could you lie
to me like...

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.452
Stand down.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:37.326
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.556
Prince N'Jobu...

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.342
you will return home
at once...

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.386
where you will face
the Council...

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.226
and inform them
of your crimes.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:02.684
Check up!

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.404
Guard your man,
guard your man!

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.701
Yo.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.667
<i>The tiny nation of Wakanda</i>

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.621
<i>is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.</i>

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:06.290
<i>The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...</i>

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:07.549
<i>after a terrorist attack</i>

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.297
<i>at the United Nations
a week ago.</i>

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:12.634
<i>The suspect
has since been apprehended.</i>

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:13.759
<i>Though it remains one of</i>

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.119
<i>the poorest countries
in the world...</i>

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.884
<i>fortified by
mountain ranges...</i>

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.678
<i>and an impenetrable
rainforest...</i>

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.937
<i>Wakanda does not engage</i>

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.686
<i>in international trade
or accept aid.</i>

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.100
<i>The succession
of the throne...</i>

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.547
<i>is expected to fall
to the oldest</i>

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.857
<i>of the king's two children...</i>

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.362
<i>Prince T'Challa.</i>

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.232
My Prince...

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.321
coming up on them now.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.760
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.022
Hmm.

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.936
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.196
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.906
What are you talking about?

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.697
I never freeze.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:36.826
What's going on?

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.388
It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.678
The car no start.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.146
What happened?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.521
The engine failed.

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.183
Ours, too.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.482
What is it, Captain?

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.417
Defense positions.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.868
Defense positions.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.378
Are we under attack?

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.959
Defense positions.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.257
Get around to the side.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.301
Defense positions.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.632
Hey. Defense positions!

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.681
No games.

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.204
What do you see?

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:56.759
Come in. Come in.

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.257
Over there! Look back!

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.099
Watch out!

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.324
T'Challa, no!

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.744
This one's just a boy.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.255
He got kidnapped as well.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.341
Nakia...

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:39.924
I...

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.639
- I wanted...
- Hey!

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.472
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.391
I will shoot her right now.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.149
You froze.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.147
Ah...

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.991
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.369
My father is dead, Nakia.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:12.540
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.584
And I wish for you
to be there.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.381
Carry yourselves home now.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.475
Thank you.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.120
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.514
Thank you oh.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.395
You will speak
nothing of this day.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:39.907
Yes.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:41.783
Thank you.

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:43.827
Thank you.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.566
Sister Nakia...

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.531
My Prince...

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:24.941
we are home.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.855
This never gets old.

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.046
Queen Mother...

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:00.958
Princess...

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.048
My comfort for your loss.

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:04.257
Thank you, Nakia.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.044
It is so good
to have you back with us.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.366
Take her to
the River Province

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.630
to prepare her
for the ceremony.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:11.928
Yes, General.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.225
Did he freeze?

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:24.694
Like an antelope
in headlights.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.321
Are you finished?

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.279
So surprised
my little sister came

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.285
to see me off
before our big day.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:37.459
You wish!

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:40.285
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.625
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.279
How many times
do I have to teach you?

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.631
Just because something works

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.425
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.757
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.054
More than you.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.721
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.806
to your ceremonial outfit.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.396
Shuri!

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.182
Sorry, Mother!

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.026
How are you
feeling today, Mama?

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.566
Proud.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.325
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.862
He is with us...

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:18.077
and it is your time
to be king.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:37.892
Good morning.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.561
How can I help you?

00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.597
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:43.892
They tell me
you're the expert.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.230
Ah. You could say that.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.066
They're beautiful.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.690
Where's this one from?

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.325
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:55.735
present day Ghana...

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:56.994
19th century.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.165
For real?

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.158
What about this one?

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.961
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.997
16th century.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:13.090
Now, tell me about this one.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.052
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:19.225
Fula tribe, I believe.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:21.769
Nah.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.596
I beg your pardon?

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.640
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:26.896
But it's from Wakanda.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.559
And it's made
out of vibranium.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:32.355
Don't trip.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.906
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.285
These items aren't for sale.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.034
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.698
You think they paid
a fair price?

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.038
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.127
Sir, I'm going to have to

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:47.670
ask you to leave.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.296
You got
all this security in here

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:50.873
watching me
ever since I walked in.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.488
But you ain't checking for

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.549
what you put in your body.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.879
All right, mate.
Let's have it.

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:57.509
Come on, mate. Time.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.323
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.684
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.562
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:05.834
Medical emergency
right away

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.377
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.401
Look out.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:11.103
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.988
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.491
I'm gonna take a break.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.017
Let's give the lady
some space, please.

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:23.143
Step back,
please, gents.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.453
Step back, please.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.213
Hey, come here.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.250
Come here. It's okay.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:37.137
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:44.873
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:45.958
Because it's better to leave

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.222
the crime scene
more spread out.

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.899
Makes us look like amateurs.

00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:07.868
Now then,
let's see if you know

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.544
what you're talking about.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.428
That's just a taste.

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.147
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.941
It's already sold!

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:40.744
Whatever you try,

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:41.930
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.410
That'll make my day.

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:44.897
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.250
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.206
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:33.873
Onward!

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.330
Onward!

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:54.871
I, Zuri...

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.170
son of Badu...

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.081
give to you...

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:01.420
Prince T'Challa...

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.301
the Black Panther!

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.803
The prince...

00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:14.596
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.015
stripped away.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:50.844
Praise the ancestors.

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.307
Praise the ancestors.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.479
Victory in ritual combat...

00:21:56.649 --> 00:22:00.187
comes by yield or death.

00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:03.899
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:05.905
I now offer...

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:09.533
a path to the throne.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:17.951
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:24.041
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:29.754
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.725
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:37.808
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:41.892
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:48.489
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:51.902
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:53.573
Mother!

00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:20.476
- Are they Jabari?
- Yes.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.192
M'Baku, what are you
doing here?

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.320
It's challenge day.

00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:43.161
We have watched...

00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:46.293
and listened
from the mountains!

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:48.424
We have watched
with disgust...

00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:51.382
as your
technological advancements

00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:53.554
have been overseen by a child!

00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:59.598
Who scoffs at tradition!

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:03.264
And now you want to
hand the nation

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:05.270
over to this prince...

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:11.406
who could not keep
his own father safe.

00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:14.988
Mmm?

00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:18.079
We will not have it.

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:22.333
I said,
we will not have it, oh!

00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:24.995
I, M'Baku...

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.251
leader of the Jabari...

00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:32.714
I accept your challenge,
M'Baku.

00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:35.925
Glory to Hanuman.

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:56.200
Jabari!

00:24:56.912 --> 00:24:57.912
Dora Milaje!

00:24:58.414 --> 00:24:59.414
Onward!

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:09.247
Let the challenge begin!

00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:21.847
Oh!

00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:25.648
Stand up!

00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:36.615
Come!

00:25:44.126 --> 00:25:46.208
T'Challa!

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.882
Where is your god now?

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.810
Yes!

00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.440
No powers.

00:26:14.782 --> 00:26:16.238
No claws.

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:19.195
No special suit, oh!

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:22.407
Just a boy not fit to lead!

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.573
Show him who you are!

00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:43.849
I am Prince T'Challa...

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:45.601
son of King T'Chaka!

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:47.387
You can do this, T'Challa!

00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:02.203
Yes!

00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:03.746
Come on!

00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:06.076
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.832
I would rather die!

00:27:11.255 --> 00:27:12.255
T'Challa!

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:14.465
T'Challa!

00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:16.217
T'Challa!

00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:18.219
T'Challa!

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:20.054
T'Challa!

00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:21.254
You have fought with honor!

00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:24.014
Now yield!
Your people need you.

00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:25.184
T'Challa!

00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:26.602
T'Challa!

00:27:26.687 --> 00:27:27.848
Yield, man!

00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.261
T'Challa!

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.690
T'Challa!

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:35.018
Yes! Yes!

00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:59.175
I now present to you...

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.676
King T'Challa...

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.257
the Black Panther.

00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:13.389
Zuri.

00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:15.524
My King.

00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:27.821
Wakanda forever!

00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:30.080
Wakanda forever!

00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:04.027
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:07.364
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:11.405
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:15.997
T'Chaka...

00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:19.163
we call on you.

00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:22.208
Come here to your son.

00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:36.184
Praise the ancestors.

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:07.198
Father.

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:08.735
My son.

00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:19.582
I'm sorry.

00:31:19.753 --> 00:31:21.539
Stand up.

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.920
You are a king.

00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:40.846
What is wrong my son?

00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:43.606
I am not ready.

00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:46.776
Have you not prepared

00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:51.157
to be king your whole life?

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:54.864
Have you not trained
and studied,

00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:57.867
been by my side?

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:02.284
That is not
what I am talking about.

00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:09.421
I am not ready
to be without you.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.587
A man who has not prepared
his children

00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:15.218
for his own death...

00:32:15.392 --> 00:32:17.554
has failed as a father.

00:32:17.727 --> 00:32:20.264
Have I ever failed you?

00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:22.312
Never.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.563
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:35.280
I want to be
a great king, <i>Baba.</i>

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.241
Just like you.

00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:40.826
You're going to struggle.

00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.833
So you'll need to
surround yourself

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:44.626
with people you trust.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:48.039
You're a good man
with a good heart.

00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:51.546
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

00:32:56.057 --> 00:32:57.343
Breathe.

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.054
T'Challa, breathe.

00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:03.228
Breathe.

00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:05.773
He was there.

00:33:07.444 --> 00:33:10.527
He was there. My father.

00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:27.379
Just one?

00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:36.053
Come home, Nakia.

00:33:36.223 --> 00:33:37.463
I'm right here.

00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:39.097
Stay.

00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:43.261
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:44.803
but I can't stay.

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:48.807
I found my calling out there.

00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:52.436
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:54.445
I can't be happy here...

00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:57.324
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:01.370
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:03.664
Share what we have.

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:05.323
We could provide aid...

00:34:05.502 --> 00:34:06.502
and access to technology

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:07.826
and refuge
to those who need it.

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:10.412
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:15.005
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

00:34:16.596 --> 00:34:18.241
If the world found out
what we truly are...

00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:19.755
what we possess...

00:34:19.933 --> 00:34:21.594
we could lose our way of life.

00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:24.055
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:25.977
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

00:34:27.774 --> 00:34:30.687
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.318
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

00:34:33.488 --> 00:34:36.981
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:45.743
Is that him?

00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:50.999
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:53.507
Of course.

00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:56.333
I see Nakia is back.

00:34:57.846 --> 00:34:59.046
You guys going to work it out?

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:06.468
T'Challa...

00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:08.724
what's wrong?

00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:10.480
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.650
More, like what?

00:35:11.818 --> 00:35:14.059
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:16.069
You let the refugees in...

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.697
they bring their problems
with them.

00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:21.154
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.863
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.540
to go out there
and clean up the world,

00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:30.243
then I'll be all for it.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.627
But waging war
on other countries

00:35:32.714 --> 00:35:34.296
has never been our way.

00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:40.054
You, too, huh?

00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:41.882
Bast! We're in trouble.

00:35:44.893 --> 00:35:46.008
<i>My King.</i>

00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:47.936
<i>My love.</i>

00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:51.563
<i>You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.</i>

00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:57.148
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:59.984
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:04.276
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...

00:36:04.454 --> 00:36:07.287
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

00:36:07.457 --> 00:36:08.788
in South Korea...

00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:10.369
tomorrow night.

00:36:12.087 --> 00:36:15.955
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:20.384
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:23.636
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:28.426
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:29.853
We need a king.

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.683
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:35.565
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

00:36:35.652 --> 00:36:37.734
about what Klaue took from us.

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.364
From me.

00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:43.445
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:44.733
Take me with you.

00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:46.819
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:50.034
I need you here
protecting the border.

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.448
Then I ask...

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.742
you kill him
where he stands...

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.002
or you bring him back to us.

00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:58.292
You have my word.

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.167
I will bring him back.

00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:05.675
We will proceed
with the mission.

00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:52.728
My King!

00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:54.637
Stop it. Stop it.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.812
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.311
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?

00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:03.820
Okoye.

00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:06.398
And Nakia as well.

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:12.029
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:13.580
Yes.

00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:15.786
We'll be fine.

00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:17.797
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.123
Yes!

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.664
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:24.208
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

00:38:25.053 --> 00:38:26.714
Unlimited range,

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:29.547
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:31.055
Check these out.

00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:35.385
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:38.351
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:40.057
Ah.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.191
And what are these?

00:38:42.362 --> 00:38:45.275
The real question is
what are those?

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:48.009
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

00:38:48.076 --> 00:38:50.067
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

00:38:50.245 --> 00:38:53.033
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

00:38:53.206 --> 00:38:55.117
I bet the Elders loved that.

00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:57.376
Try them on.

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.499
Fully automated.

00:39:02.924 --> 00:39:05.165
Like the old American movie
<i>Baba</i> used to watch.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.260
Mmm.

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.506
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

00:39:10.682 --> 00:39:11.682
Interesting.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.591
Guess what I call them.

00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.133
Sneakers.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.095
Because you...

00:39:18.273 --> 00:39:19.434
Never mind.

00:39:20.984 --> 00:39:22.344
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

00:39:22.485 --> 00:39:26.649
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:27.938
Exhibit A.

00:39:28.116 --> 00:39:29.652
- My design.
- Old tech.

00:39:29.826 --> 00:39:32.067
- Old?
- Functional, but old.

00:39:32.245 --> 00:39:33.906
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.

00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:35.954
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."

00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:37.706
Enough.

00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:40.750
Now, look at these.

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:44.712
Do you like that one?

00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:46.169
Tempting.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.383
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.222
This one.

00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:00.933
Now tell it to go on.

00:40:06.279 --> 00:40:07.485
Ooh!

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:11.694
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:13.988
Strike it.

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:16.161
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:21.287
Not that hard, genius!

00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:23.668
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:25.124
I invite you to my lab,

00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:26.670
and you just
kick things around?

00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:29.549
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:30.671
Hey.

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:32.298
Wait a minute.

00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:35.180
The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.762
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

00:40:37.936 --> 00:40:39.267
Very nice.

00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:42.099
Strike it again
in the same spot.

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:46.266
You're recording?

00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:48.602
For research purposes.

00:40:56.037 --> 00:40:57.243
Delete that footage.

00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:18.845
This way.

00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:23.470
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:26.640
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:30.027
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:32.858
What? It's a disgrace.

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:36.487
Hello Sophia.

00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:38.993
Good to see you.

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:41.871
Who are these two?

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:44.078
My friends from Kenya.

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:46.626
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:49.504
Good for trouble...

00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:51.256
...like you?

00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:01.557
Thank you!

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:25.695
Spread out.

00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:28.202
The buyer
is likely already here.

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.805
The woman outside.

00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:50.936
What trouble
was she referring to?

00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:53.815
Ah... I got into
a disagreement

00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:55.737
with some ivory traders.

00:42:55.907 --> 00:42:57.944
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.

00:42:58.034 --> 00:43:00.196
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:02.197
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:03.532
Depends...

00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:05.913
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:07.916
<i>Can we please focus?</i>

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.956
Thank you.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.590
Over here.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.132
One whiskey, please.

00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:29.559
Eyes up. Americans.

00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:34.355
I count three.

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:37.729
Five.

00:43:37.907 --> 00:43:39.301
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:40.565
there behind you?

00:43:40.743 --> 00:43:41.858
Six.

00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:45.449
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:48.206
It just got
a little more complicated.

00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:52.619
Agent Ross.

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:53.912
Your Highness.

00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:56.005
You are buying from Klaue.

00:43:57.969 --> 00:43:59.710
What I'm doing or not doing...

00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:01.298
on behalf of
the U.S. government

00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:02.595
is none of your concern.

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:04.426
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.682
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:08.139
I gave you Zemo.

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:09.677
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...

00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:11.472
that the king of
a third world country

00:44:11.566 --> 00:44:13.523
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:15.058
I'd say we were even.

00:44:15.236 --> 00:44:16.818
You really need to leave, now.

00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:20.780
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

00:44:21.868 --> 00:44:23.484
You've been warned.

00:44:25.413 --> 00:44:26.448
Three, craps.

00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:28.321
Hey, you won!

00:44:29.876 --> 00:44:31.162
You know what?

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.326
I think
I'll just take these...

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.211
bring them over here

00:44:35.298 --> 00:44:37.630
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.344
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.221
He cannot leave with Klaue.

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:47.767
All right.

00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:49.335
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia

00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:50.395
links back to a person...

00:44:50.563 --> 00:44:51.683
that I'm not actually saying

00:44:51.772 --> 00:44:52.916
I'm here to make
a deal with...

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.307
but that deal
will not be called off.

00:44:55.484 --> 00:44:56.724
When the dust settles,

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:58.355
you and me can work
something out.

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.395
I'm not here to make a deal.

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:29.303
Klaue, plus eight!

00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:30.644
General.

00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:32.677
In position
to secure our exit.

00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:33.855
And the vibranium?

00:45:33.981 --> 00:45:35.642
I don't see it yet.

00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:38.399
<i>I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.</i>

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.310
There's not supposed to be.

00:45:40.488 --> 00:45:42.855
Somebody did not get the memo.

00:45:43.783 --> 00:45:45.365
Definitely armed.

00:45:46.202 --> 00:45:48.068
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:49.407
You got a mixtape coming out?

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.197
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, actually, there is one.

00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:54.241
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.854
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.558
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.430
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:01.957
You think they're for you?

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:04.255
Don't worry.

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.294
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:07.550
thank you very much.

00:46:14.981 --> 00:46:17.473
<i>Six more. It's a setup.</i>

00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:19.728
You got the diamonds?

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.185
Okay. That's enough.

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.689
- We need to move on Klaue.
<i>- Stand down.</i>

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:28.779
We can't afford a shootout.

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:29.953
Vibranium?

00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:41.371
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:44.041
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.126
It's now or never.

00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:47.419
Stand down!

00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:49.014
Hey!

00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:04.415
Wakandans! They're here!

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.130
- Get outta here!
- Kill 'em all!

00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:11.317
Diamonds, quick!

00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:09.094
Murderer!

00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:17.975
You know, you look just like
your old man.

00:48:27.488 --> 00:48:29.855
I made it rain!

00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:31.656
Let's get out of here, boss!

00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:38.363
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:41.078
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

00:48:42.962 --> 00:48:45.420
- Do we just leave him?
- He'll catch up.

00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:54.796
Shuri!

00:48:58.394 --> 00:48:59.394
Yes!

00:48:59.562 --> 00:49:01.974
<i>Remote
driving system activated.</i>

00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:04.522
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:05.723
<i>For Bast's sake!</i>

00:49:05.901 --> 00:49:07.232
<i>- Just drive!</i>
- Okay, calm down!

00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:17.201
Whoo! Let's go!

00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:19.578
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:24.666
Which one is he in now?

00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:28.295
Hey, split Up!

00:49:30.092 --> 00:49:32.092
- They're trying to lose us.
- I'll take the right.

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:36.463
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:53.771
We're not going to make it!

00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:56.532
Keep going!

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.616
Whoo! Brother!

00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:15.592
Hey, what was that?

00:50:15.763 --> 00:50:17.963
Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.

00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:30.308
Guns.

00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:32.852
So primitive!

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.862
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

00:50:34.949 --> 00:50:36.110
The bullets won't penetrate!

00:50:38.327 --> 00:50:39.362
What are you doing?

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:40.743
Just drive.

00:50:57.388 --> 00:50:58.799
- Whoo!
- Shit!

00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:13.813
Hey, look at your suit.

00:51:13.988 --> 00:51:15.103
You've been taking bullets,

00:51:15.197 --> 00:51:17.063
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.391
Pull around the truck.

00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:26.205
Where'd he go?

00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:36.924
You show-off.

00:51:38.178 --> 00:51:39.178
There he is!

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:42.599
Hold tight!

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.720
All right.
Let's have some fun!

00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:16.924
Hop in.

00:52:17.426 --> 00:52:19.793
Put that spear in the trunk.

00:52:25.017 --> 00:52:26.177
Faster, Shuri.

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.926
I'm going as fast as I can!

00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:30.811
Take a right! Take a right!

00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:36.608
No, no, no!

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.066
Brother!

00:53:03.555 --> 00:53:04.590
Klaue!

00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:08.349
Did you think we would forget?

00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:19.360
Look at me, murderer!

00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:21.771
Where did you get this weapon?

00:53:22.157 --> 00:53:24.615
You savages didn't deserve it.

00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:30.746
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

00:53:30.916 --> 00:53:33.032
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.450
King!

00:53:35.087 --> 00:53:36.953
The world watches.

00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:39.042
Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?

00:53:44.805 --> 00:53:45.805
Yeah.

00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:01.769
Hello.

00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:07.446
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:17.376
So this is a big mess, huh?

00:54:17.546 --> 00:54:19.753
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.643
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:25.176
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:31.215
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:34.223
than to make a scene here.

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:36.728
After your questioning,

00:54:36.815 --> 00:54:38.726
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

00:54:38.901 --> 00:54:41.438
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:44.400
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:46.234
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor

00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:47.907
by letting you
even be in here.

00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:52.736
If he touches you again,

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.664
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

00:54:56.585 --> 00:54:57.916
Does she speak English?

00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:00.002
When she wants to.

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:01.874
Huh.

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.000
I'm going in.

00:55:03.091 --> 00:55:05.253
When I'm done,
you guys are up.

00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:07.168
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?

00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:10.634
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:12.389
You see that?

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:14.137
It's called diplomacy.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:16.270
You're welcome.

00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:20.606
Okoye.

00:55:20.692 --> 00:55:21.773
Play nice.

00:55:21.944 --> 00:55:23.025
Americans.

00:55:35.082 --> 00:55:37.082
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.453
I'm much more your speed.

00:55:38.627 --> 00:55:40.459
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

00:55:40.629 --> 00:55:43.121
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

00:55:43.298 --> 00:55:44.459
Where'd you get that?

00:55:44.633 --> 00:55:46.486
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:48.877
But I can get you one,
if you like.

00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:50.934
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,

00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:52.008
and I'll ask them.

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:53.638
He's right outside.

00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:55.391
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

00:55:55.561 --> 00:55:57.051
What? T'Challa?

00:55:57.229 --> 00:56:00.563
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:01.732
Bingo.

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:06.064
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

00:56:06.238 --> 00:56:07.478
Um...

00:56:08.657 --> 00:56:10.739
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:12.389
<i>It's all a front.</i>

00:56:12.828 --> 00:56:15.411
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:18.039
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.540
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America...</i>

00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:23.578
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:25.541
A technological marvel.

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:28.128
All because it was built
on a mound

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.255
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

00:56:30.429 --> 00:56:33.512
<i>Isipho,</i> they call it.
The gift.

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:35.214
Vibranium.

00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:37.554
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:38.934
It's not just a metal.

00:56:39.104 --> 00:56:41.641
They sew it
into their clothes.

00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:44.603
It powers their city,
their tech...

00:56:44.776 --> 00:56:46.016
their weapons.

00:56:46.695 --> 00:56:47.776
Weapons?

00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:48.946
Yeah.

00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:51.443
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:52.903
That's a nice fairy tale,

00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:54.904
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.536
and you stole
all their vibranium.

00:56:57.706 --> 00:56:58.992
I stole...

00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:03.617
All of it?

00:57:04.922 --> 00:57:07.505
I took a tiny piece of it.

00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:09.381
They have
a mountain full of it.

00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:11.758
<i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years...</i>

00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:14.170
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

00:57:14.348 --> 00:57:16.305
<i>I'm the only outsider
who's seen it</i>

00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:17.973
<i>and got out of there alive.</i>

00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:19.804
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>

00:57:19.895 --> 00:57:23.138
<i>you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.</i>

00:57:23.482 --> 00:57:26.065
What his claws are made of.

00:57:49.174 --> 00:57:50.756
Your father told the UN...

00:57:50.926 --> 00:57:53.839
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

00:57:54.012 --> 00:57:55.548
But now he's telling me
you have more.

00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:57.133
And you believe the word

00:57:57.224 --> 00:57:59.716
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:19.610
Where is that?

00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:22.371
Back there.

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:35.508
How much more are you hiding?

00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:38.837
Something is happening
out back.

00:58:45.063 --> 00:58:46.098
Get down!

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:52.021
Stand down!

00:58:55.574 --> 00:58:56.574
Cover!

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:57.700
Grenade!

00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:03.571
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:24.554
My King!

00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:29.017
My King.

00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:30.306
Nakia.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.856
He just jumped in front of me.

00:59:37.699 --> 00:59:39.360
I don't think
he'll make it here.

00:59:39.451 --> 00:59:40.816
It hit his spine.

00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:45.162
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.414
This will stabilize him
for now.

00:59:59.471 --> 01:00:00.961
Give him to us.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.380
We can save him.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:14.809
Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.277
We failed.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:20.655
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.363
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:24.777
He took a bullet for me.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.662
That was his choice.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:29.365
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.375
Let us consider
that we heal him.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:34.791
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.623
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.213
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:44.009
I cannot just let him die...

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.217
knowing we can save him.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.806
Where exactly
are we taking him?

01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:00.233
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.364
This is going to be fun.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:10.697
He will live.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:16.332
W'Kabi is here.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.972
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.008
He's not here.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.102
He slipped through our hands.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:38.900
"Slipped"?

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:44.653
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:47.033
With you,
I thought it'd be different.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.911
But it's more of the same.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.433
Let's get going, boss.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.811
You always sell to the CIA?

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.892
I sell to the highest bidder.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.183
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.647
and I lay low for a bit,

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.217
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.091
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:25.115
I know you good for it.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.866
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.013
You don't want to
go there, boy.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:30.037
Yeah, I do.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:33.999
Drop it!

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.621
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:37.997
ends today.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.536
Put your gun down now!

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.296
I'm sorry.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.707
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.617
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:17.123
They're savages.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:21.207
This is what they do
to people like us.

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:22.692
I ain't worried
about no brand.

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.172
Check these out.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:26.875
Each one is for a kill.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.053
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:33.011
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:35.471
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:45.318
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:00.913
Leave us!

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:15.341
So your mission did not go
as planned.

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:20.100
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:23.603
My father told me
he disappeared.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.143
There was a man today...

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:31.031
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.568
That is not possible.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.448
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:40.866
My grandfather's ring!

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.580
Do not tell me
what is possible.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:43.705
Tell me the truth!

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.000
Some truths...

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:56.465
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.969
That is not your choice
to make.

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:01.855
What happened to him?

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.476
I promised the king
to say nothing.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.482
I am your king now!

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:23.412
Your uncle took...

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:28.585
a War Dog assignment
in America.

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:32.592
Your father...

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:35.095
placed me there...

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:36.974
<i>to observe...</i>

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.642
unbeknownst to him.

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:43.725
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.521
They had a child.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.275
The hardships he saw there...

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.737
radicalized your uncle.

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:55.114
I observed
for as long as I could.

01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:57.943
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.533
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.074
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.284
All over the planet...

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:06.748
our people suffer because

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.829
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.127
With vibranium weapons,

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.799
they could overthrow
every country...

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.755
and Wakanda could
rule them all

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:16.132
the right way.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:19.844
He knew your father
would not support this.

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:23.810
So, your uncle betrayed us.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.186
No!

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:28.599
<i>He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.</i>

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.564
No, no, no.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.320
You will return home
at once...

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.322
where you will face
the Council...

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:38.450
and inform them
of your crimes.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.327
<i>He drew his weapon
on me.</i>

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.738
No!

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:01.590
<i>Your father
killed his own brother...</i>

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:05.636
to save my life.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:12.644
Speak nothing of this.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.315
And the Child?

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:23.699
We left him.

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:33.292
We had to...

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:35.586
maintain...

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.339
the lie.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.241
What is this?

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.280
Just a little gift.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.310
Who are you?

01:09:21.699 --> 01:09:23.189
All right, where am I?

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.984
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!

01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:28.320
What?
My name is Everett.

01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:31.615
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

01:09:31.793 --> 01:09:34.581
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

01:09:35.088 --> 01:09:36.123
Right.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.254
Okay, is this Wakanda?

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.044
No, it's Kansas.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.886
How long ago was Korea?

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.175
Yesterday.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:51.353
I don't think so.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.724
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:56.022
They do here.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:59.435
But not by magic,
by technology.

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:07.071
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.268
These train things...

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:35.679
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:36.892
Obviously.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:41.310
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.146
The light panels,
what are they?

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:47.740
<i>- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?</i>

01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:49.405
In its raw form...

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.195
vibranium is too dangerous

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:53.030
to be transported
at that speed...

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:56.290
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.980
<i>There's vibranium
on those trains?</i>

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.295
There's vibranium
all around us.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.632
That's how I healed you.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.180
<i>Where is T'Challa?</i>

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:16.344
<i>His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.</i>

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:18.763
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.227
<i>A man showed up at the border</i>

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:21.604
<i>who claims
to have killed Klaue.</i>

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:22.778
What?

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.399
<i>W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.</i>

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.405
<i>We need to find your brother!</i>

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:28.575
An outsider?

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.359
<i>No, a Wakandan.</i>

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:31.947
He's not a Wakandan.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:35.788
He's one of ours.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.842
He killed his own brother...

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:53.177
and left a child behind...

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:54.591
with nothing.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.178
What kind of king...

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:02.269
What kind of man does that?

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:04.650
No man is perfect.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:06.861
Not even your father.

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:09.739
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.702
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.160
he may have created something
even worse.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:19.584
Hey.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.581
Look at me.

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:29.710
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:35.966
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.649
<i>Brother, you need to
get here now!</i>

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.355
Erik Stevens.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:49.028
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.109
MIT for grad school.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.446
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.030
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:56.202
like it was a video game.

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:58.405
Started calling him
Killmonger.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:01.245
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:02.830
They will drop off the grid...

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:04.284
so they can
commit assassinations

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:05.453
and take down governments.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:09.667
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:11.501
He has
a War Dog tattoo...

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:14.762
but we have no record of him.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.312
Is this man Wakandan or not?

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.353
Tell us what is going on.

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:46.831
Speak.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.256
Speak.

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:52.458
I'm standing in your house...

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.002
serving justice to a man

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:56.383
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.584
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.606
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:09.108
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.232
is because I know who you are.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.192
Now, what do you want?

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:17.450
I want the throne.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.161
My goodness.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.957
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:27.076
Must feel good.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.287
It's about two billion people

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:30.998
all over the world
that looks like us.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.549
But their lives
are a lot harder.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.006
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.387
And what tools are those?

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:41.637
Vibranium. Your weapons.

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:45.429
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:49.349
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.359
for people
who are not our own.

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:53.402
Not your own?

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:56.030
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.611
So ain't all people
your people?

01:14:57.785 --> 01:15:01.403
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:04.155
And it is my responsibility

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.116
to make sure
our people are safe...

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:08.500
and that vibranium
does not fall

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:10.373
into the hands
of a person like you.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:11.788
- Mmm...
- Son.

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:14.423
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.342
Reject his request.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.004
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.843
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:24.675
An American black operative.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.561
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:27.647
That's who you are.

01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:29.351
That's not my name, Princess.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:31.099
Ask me, King.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:32.438
No.

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:34.686
Ask me.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.444
Take him away.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:40.910
Who are you?

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.364
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.535
Son of N'Jobu?

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.729
I found my daddy

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:49.855
with Panther claws
in his chest!

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.961
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:53.246
You're lying!

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.464
- Lies!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:58.964
What?

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:02.593
The descendent of N'Jobu.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.303
Hey, Auntie.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:09.724
I'm exercising my blood right

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:11.476
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.232
and Black Panther.

01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:19.313
Do not do this, T'Challa.

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:21.654
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.360
he is within his rights.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:24.823
He has no rights here!

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.079
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:30.458
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:32.869
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.209
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.128
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.890
I accept your challenge.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:05.401
He'll never beat T'Challa.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.661
He should've just come
to the first challenge

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.489
and gotten it over with.

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.873
The king
will now have the strength

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:20.709
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:53.996
Where is Agent Ross?

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.912
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.296
This is your last chance.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:07.138
Throw down your weapons,

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:09.841
and we can handle this
another way.

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:21.193
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:25.072
I trained, I lied, I killed...

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:26.949
just to get here.

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:31.329
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.244
Iraq.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:37.702
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:38.957
right here on this continent.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:43.086
And all this death...

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:46.670
just so I could kill you.

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:57.522
Let the challenge begin.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:37.105
Yield!

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:00.208
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:21.607
Come on, get up.

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:23.943
Come here.

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:28.942
This is for my father.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:31.695
Erik!

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:34.118
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:35.702
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:37.864
I am the cause of
your father's death.

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:39.248
Not him.

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:40.954
Take me.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:43.878
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.380
No!

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:48.925
No! No!

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:51.631
Zuri, no!

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:53.973
No!

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.809
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:00.144
No! No!

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.646
Is this your king? Huh?

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:09.191
Is this your king?

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.027
The Black Panther,

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.908
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.573
Come on, Brother!

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:22.071
Is there nothing
that can be done?

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.536
Him?

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:27.792
He's supposed to protect you?

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:41.685
- No.
- No!

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:51.107
No!

01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:56.696
Nah. I'm your king.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.531
- No! No!
- We have to go now!

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:00.787
Queen Mother, let's go!

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.325
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.156
Yes.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:41.612
Thank you.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.157
We should get
to them immediately.

01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:46.201
I cannot.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:46.958
What?

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.540
Though my heart is with you.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.252
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:54.049
who showed up here
only hours ago.

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:55.136
He is of royal blood.

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:57.549
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.

01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:59.555
Does that really matter?

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:05.140
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:09.311
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:10.600
Overthrow?

01:23:11.528 --> 01:23:12.643
Nakia!

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:16.856
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:23.079
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:25.414
What are you loyal to?

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:30.290
I loved him.

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:34.002
I loved my country, too.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:36.213
Then you serve your country.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:39.549
No. I save my country.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:49.642
What's wrong?

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.394
The king is dead.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:54.689
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.006
First <i>Baba.</i>

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.093
And now my brother.

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:24.765
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:35.017
- It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.027
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.233
Where's Okoye?

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:40.405
Okoye is not coming.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:43.318
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:50.582
Wait here.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:56.964
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:01.460
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:04.596
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.554
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:45.527
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:46.909
Hmm?

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:55.120
What did you find?

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.455
Your home.

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:02.790
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.836
Yes. The sunsets there

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.716
are the most beautiful
in the world.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.141
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:16.897
Why?

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.728
They will say you are lost.

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:22.980
But I'm right here.

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:29.741
No tears for me?

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:35.281
Everybody dies.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:39.076
It's just life around here.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.374
Well, look at what
I have done.

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.462
I should've taken you back
long ago.

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:54.721
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.441
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:06.858
That's why they can't find us.

01:28:13.872 --> 01:28:16.284
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.825
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:37.430
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:41.517
This all of it?

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.557
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:44.767
we will be ready.

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:46.685
Another king?

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.940
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:53.700
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

01:28:57.374 --> 01:29:00.332
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:05.792
Burn it all!

01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:56.421
You know, where I'm from...

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.508
when black folks
started revolutions,

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:01.344
they never had
the firepower...

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:03.603
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.848
Where was Wakanda?

01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:09.445
Hmm?

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.697
Yeah, all that ends today.

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:16.985
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:18.869
Already in place.

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:20.370
I know how colonizers think.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.077
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:26.952
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:29.838
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:32.420
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.255
And their children.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:36.087
And anyone else
who takes their side.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.722
It's time they know
the truth about us!

01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:40.508
We're warriors!

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:43.848
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:48.766
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:52.189
Wakanda has survived
for so long...

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.652
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:58.442
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:02.203
But the world is changing,
General.

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:06.371
Elders, it is getting smaller.

01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:08.410
The outside world
is catching up...

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:10.579
and soon it will be
the conquerors

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:12.756
or the conquered.

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:16.380
I'd rather be the former.

01:31:18.556 --> 01:31:21.173
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.256
<i>So where are we
going again?</i>

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.928
<i>We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb</i>

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:27.022
to Jabariland.

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:28.806
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:31.396
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:34.152
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

01:31:34.698 --> 01:31:35.733
Nakia.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.986
I don't like this.

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:43.904
The Herb belongs to us.

01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:47.291
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:57.126
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:01.089
I am a spy with no army.

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:04.216
I wouldn't stand a chance.

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:07.511
We'll go.

01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:15.440
Oh, boy.

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:22.075
Oh, shit.

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:25.070
Look down. Stay calm.

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:26.248
Shuri.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:28.953
Look down.

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:05.573
My son...

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:10.244
was murdered in ritual combat.

01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:12.872
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...

01:33:13.046 --> 01:33:14.628
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.664
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:20.425
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:23.257
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.223
The new king...

01:33:35.068 --> 01:33:37.275
You cannot talk!

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.810
One more word,

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:41.146
and I will feed you
to my children.

01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:47.535
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

01:33:54.838 --> 01:33:58.047
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:03.840
this is why we are here.

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.801
To offer this to you.

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:09.926
An outsider
sits on our throne.

01:34:10.103 --> 01:34:11.935
Only you can help us stop him.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:30.825
Come with me.

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:49.219
Impossible!

01:34:55.106 --> 01:34:56.141
Is he breathing?

01:34:56.316 --> 01:34:59.058
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:01.105
<i>One of our fishermen found him</i>

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:02.812
<i>at the edge
of the river border.</i>

01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:04.275
<i>He brought him to me.</i>

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:06.190
Why do you have him
in the snow?

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:07.595
It is the only thing
keeping him

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:08.699
from joining the ancestors.

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:11.365
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.075
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

01:35:14.792 --> 01:35:16.408
Nakia, the Herb.

01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:35.268
I call upon the ancestors.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:37.687
I call upon Bast.

01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:41.149
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.

01:35:42.195 --> 01:35:43.651
Heal him.

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.541
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

01:35:58.711 --> 01:35:59.951
Okay.

01:36:12.058 --> 01:36:13.389
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:14.559
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:17.143
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:19.600
Praise the ancestors.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.107
Wake up, T'Challa.

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:24.692
<i>Wake up.</i>

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:28.529
My son.

01:36:34.956 --> 01:36:37.823
The time has come
for you to come home...

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:40.413
and be reunited with me.

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:52.800
Why?

01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:58.017
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:01.262
Why, <i>Baba?</i>

01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:04.315
He...

01:37:05.278 --> 01:37:08.566
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

01:37:09.699 --> 01:37:12.316
You were wrong to abandon him.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.359
I chose my people.

01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:17.741
I chose Wakanda.

01:37:17.915 --> 01:37:19.781
Our future depended...

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:21.495
You were wrong!

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.910
All of you were wrong!

01:37:24.964 --> 01:37:27.877
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:32.130
We let the fear
of our discovery

01:37:32.221 --> 01:37:34.804
stop us from doing
what is right!

01:37:35.892 --> 01:37:37.223
No more!

01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:44.765
I cannot stay here with you.

01:37:46.569 --> 01:37:50.813
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:54.362
He is a monster
of our own making.

01:37:56.037 --> 01:37:59.371
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:04.079
I must right these wrongs.

01:38:14.931 --> 01:38:16.592
Do you have a blanket?

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:21.226
Killmonger
has the full support

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:22.473
of our military.

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:26.769
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:28.975
Of course he did.

01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:30.856
That's what he was
trained to do.

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.646
His unit used to work
with the CIA

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.572
to destabilize
foreign countries.

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.824
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:39.156
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:41.697
You get control of government,
the military...

01:38:41.874 --> 01:38:43.956
- Our resources.
- Right.

01:38:45.086 --> 01:38:46.086
The Great Mound.

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:47.915
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

01:38:48.089 --> 01:38:50.751
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:56.382
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:57.556
- What?
- What about you?

01:38:58.474 --> 01:39:00.431
The challenge
will have to continue.

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:03.889
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

01:39:04.063 --> 01:39:06.054
It is my duty
to keep you safe.

01:39:06.232 --> 01:39:08.724
If he gets control
of our technology,

01:39:08.818 --> 01:39:10.149
nowhere will be safe.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.709
The Black Panther lives.

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:35.758
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

01:39:35.928 --> 01:39:38.465
I will be right there
beside him.

01:39:39.599 --> 01:39:40.805
As will I.

01:39:41.267 --> 01:39:42.507
I'm in, too.

01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:46.352
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:51.061
Are you done?

01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:54.273
Are you done?

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.986
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:08.617
Thank you.

01:40:09.295 --> 01:40:11.536
I owed you a great debt.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.922
A life for a life.

01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:15.627
Consider it paid.

01:40:16.302 --> 01:40:18.509
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:22.218
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

01:40:23.392 --> 01:40:26.054
You know, I could use
an army as well.

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:28.846
I bet you could.

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.180
But no.

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:34.476
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

01:40:34.654 --> 01:40:36.315
It is our cause.

01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:39.239
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?

01:40:39.408 --> 01:40:41.649
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

01:40:41.827 --> 01:40:45.786
and now you speak of "us"?

01:40:47.083 --> 01:40:49.745
I cannot speak for past kings.

01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:53.245
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

01:40:53.422 --> 01:40:56.289
We both know the power
of vibranium.

01:40:56.968 --> 01:40:59.050
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

01:40:59.136 --> 01:41:01.093
who do you think
he will come for next?

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:12.101
We will not help you.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.030
Everything is on schedule.

01:41:42.054 --> 01:41:43.215
Have the spies been alerted?

01:41:43.389 --> 01:41:45.505
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

01:41:45.891 --> 01:41:47.381
But the War Dogs in London,

01:41:47.476 --> 01:41:49.262
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.554
We'll strike there first.

01:41:52.732 --> 01:41:54.518
The others'll come around.

01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:56.057
Look at this.

01:41:56.235 --> 01:41:57.316
A handheld sonic cannon,

01:41:57.403 --> 01:41:58.768
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:00.562
untraceable by
metal detectors.

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.777
And we got thousands of them.

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:08.070
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

01:42:39.612 --> 01:42:40.818
He lives.

01:42:44.867 --> 01:42:46.778
N'Jadaka!

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.235
Wassup?

01:42:49.413 --> 01:42:51.154
I never yielded!

01:42:51.916 --> 01:42:55.625
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:58.252
All that challenge shit
is over with!

01:42:58.339 --> 01:42:59.454
I'm the king now!

01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:01.839
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:12.029
- Shuri, now.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:17.980
Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!

01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:20.608
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

01:43:21.737 --> 01:43:24.820
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:30.030
What will we do?

01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:32.536
Border Tribe!

01:43:46.595 --> 01:43:47.595
You!

01:43:47.763 --> 01:43:50.095
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

01:43:50.266 --> 01:43:52.098
you are not fit to be a king!

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.595
Come on!

01:43:57.773 --> 01:43:58.773
Ayo, the king!

01:44:14.373 --> 01:44:15.408
Shields!

01:44:46.071 --> 01:44:47.071
Ah!

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:51.865
W'Kabi, stop this!

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.610
Stop this now!

01:44:58.793 --> 01:44:59.793
No!

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:30.613
Nakia and I will get control
of the <i>Royal Talon</i> with this.

01:45:30.783 --> 01:45:32.239
So what do I do?

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:33.490
You'll have to fly it.

01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:36.281
- What?
- You were a great pilot.

01:45:36.455 --> 01:45:38.492
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:40.782
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.

01:45:41.502 --> 01:45:43.163
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:45.123
Hey, Nakia, take that.

01:45:45.297 --> 01:45:48.039
- I'm not a Dora.
- Just put it on, it's armor!

01:45:49.552 --> 01:45:50.587
Come!

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.174
Good luck, Agent Ross!

01:45:54.348 --> 01:45:55.784
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

01:45:55.808 --> 01:45:57.173
We're counting on you.

01:46:09.864 --> 01:46:11.229
Wakanda forever.

01:46:19.456 --> 01:46:20.456
Come on!

01:46:30.968 --> 01:46:32.083
Go, go!

01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:40.842
<i>Remote
piloting system activated.</i>

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:42.896
My God.

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:46.101
<i>I made it American
style for you. Get in.</i>

01:46:46.275 --> 01:46:47.811
All right.

01:46:53.991 --> 01:46:54.991
Yes!

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:59.785
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:02.825
All right, I'm on it.

01:47:19.975 --> 01:47:21.215
Lock!

01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:23.600
Get him down!

01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:25.394
Get the necklace!

01:47:25.856 --> 01:47:27.438
Get the necklace!

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:36.196
Wakanda forever!

01:47:43.999 --> 01:47:46.240
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

01:47:46.418 --> 01:47:47.783
Shoot them down, genius!

01:47:47.962 --> 01:47:48.962
All right.

01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:51.624
Here goes nothing.

01:47:58.889 --> 01:48:00.004
All right, got them.

01:48:04.353 --> 01:48:05.593
Oh, shit.

01:48:06.563 --> 01:48:08.304
Shit, Shit, shit.

01:48:28.585 --> 01:48:29.785
Nice!

01:49:04.913 --> 01:49:05.948
Shuri!

01:49:10.252 --> 01:49:11.617
What's up, Princess?

01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:13.877
You'll never be a true king.

01:49:16.842 --> 01:49:17.842
Brother!

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.286
Shuri.

01:49:51.710 --> 01:49:52.710
Brother!

01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:55.248
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:57.459
<i>The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!</i>

01:49:57.633 --> 01:49:58.964
You won't have protection!

01:49:59.134 --> 01:50:00.465
Neither will he.

01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:02.001
Okay!

01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:28.319
I don't need a suit
to kill you.

01:50:28.497 --> 01:50:29.703
Your reign is over!

01:50:29.873 --> 01:50:31.455
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

01:50:31.625 --> 01:50:33.036
You want to
see us become

01:50:33.127 --> 01:50:35.038
just like the people
you hate so much.

01:50:35.212 --> 01:50:36.953
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

01:50:37.131 --> 01:50:39.543
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

01:50:39.716 --> 01:50:40.956
You have become them!

01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.627
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

01:50:43.804 --> 01:50:45.545
The world took
everything away from me!

01:50:45.722 --> 01:50:47.212
Everything I ever loved!

01:50:47.391 --> 01:50:48.847
But I'mma make sure
we're even.

01:50:49.017 --> 01:50:50.203
I'mma track down
anyone who would

01:50:50.227 --> 01:50:51.717
even think
about being loyal to you!

01:50:51.895 --> 01:50:53.289
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

01:50:53.313 --> 01:50:54.394
right next to Zuri!

01:50:56.692 --> 01:50:57.978
Nakia!

01:51:01.113 --> 01:51:02.899
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay. You?

01:51:03.073 --> 01:51:04.814
- Yes.
- Let's go.

01:51:11.957 --> 01:51:14.244
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

01:51:16.670 --> 01:51:17.876
Shit. What the hell was that?

01:51:18.046 --> 01:51:19.440
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

01:51:19.464 --> 01:51:20.499
What? Where?

01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:22.502
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

01:51:26.555 --> 01:51:29.388
<i>Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!</i>

01:51:29.975 --> 01:51:31.340
How long have I got?

01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:35.098
<i>Glass integrity is at 50%.</i>

01:51:35.898 --> 01:51:36.933
Put me back in.

01:51:37.107 --> 01:51:38.814
<i>Ross! Ross!</i>

01:51:57.711 --> 01:51:59.201
Surrender now!

01:51:59.671 --> 01:52:02.538
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:03.831
One!

01:52:03.967 --> 01:52:04.967
Two!

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:19.264
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

01:53:00.357 --> 01:53:02.689
<i>Glass integrity is at 15%.</i>

01:53:11.576 --> 01:53:13.533
<i>- Critical weapons failure.</i>
- Shit!

01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:20.366
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:21.700
is almost at the border...

01:53:21.878 --> 01:53:23.189
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

01:53:23.213 --> 01:53:24.499
Make an X with your arms!

01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:27.506
<i>Sonic Overload initiated.</i>

01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:29.508
Now break it!

01:53:38.437 --> 01:53:40.348
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

01:53:40.814 --> 01:53:42.896
<i>four, three...</i>

01:53:43.066 --> 01:53:44.682
<i>two, one.</i>

01:53:45.277 --> 01:53:46.392
<i>System rebooted.</i>

01:53:58.707 --> 01:54:00.038
Yes! We did it!

01:54:00.208 --> 01:54:01.744
<i>Great!
Now get out of there!</i>

01:54:12.929 --> 01:54:14.215
Charge!

01:54:34.034 --> 01:54:36.366
Drop your weapon!

01:54:37.913 --> 01:54:40.075
Would you kill me, my love?

01:54:40.248 --> 01:54:41.704
For Wakanda?

01:54:45.003 --> 01:54:46.710
Without question!

01:55:30.715 --> 01:55:32.251
This is it for you, Cousin.

01:55:57.993 --> 01:55:59.529
Hell of a move!

01:56:20.724 --> 01:56:22.306
My pop said Wakanda was

01:56:22.392 --> 01:56:23.974
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

01:56:27.689 --> 01:56:30.181
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.442
You believe that?

01:56:34.321 --> 01:56:35.436
Kid from Oakland,

01:56:35.530 --> 01:56:37.396
running around
believing in fairy tales.

01:57:25.789 --> 01:57:27.700
It's beautiful.

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:44.300
Maybe we can still heal you.

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:47.887
Why?

01:57:49.688 --> 01:57:51.895
So you can just lock me up?

01:57:55.151 --> 01:57:56.482
Nah.

01:57:58.697 --> 01:58:00.358
Just bury me in the ocean...

01:58:00.532 --> 01:58:03.069
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:07.278
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:32.831
Thank you.

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:36.416
You saved me.

01:59:37.337 --> 01:59:39.453
You saved my family.

01:59:41.675 --> 01:59:43.086
Our nation.

01:59:43.259 --> 01:59:45.591
There's nothing
to thank me for.

01:59:45.762 --> 01:59:47.298
It is our duty to...

01:59:50.934 --> 01:59:53.596
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

01:59:54.646 --> 01:59:55.646
I should've...

02:00:02.362 --> 02:00:04.569
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

02:00:08.243 --> 02:00:09.483
Stay.

02:00:11.955 --> 02:00:13.195
I think I know a way

02:00:13.289 --> 02:00:15.530
you can still fulfill
your calling.

02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:18.121
Please stay.

02:00:51.244 --> 02:00:52.985
Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

02:00:53.163 --> 02:00:54.824
- Who man is that?
- Bucket!

02:00:54.998 --> 02:00:55.998
Easy.

02:00:59.002 --> 02:01:00.333
When you said
you would take me

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.331
to California
for the first time...

02:01:02.505 --> 02:01:04.462
I thought
you meant Coachella...

02:01:04.632 --> 02:01:06.088
or Disneyland.

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.171
Why here?

02:01:11.306 --> 02:01:14.765
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

02:01:19.981 --> 02:01:21.722
They're tearing it down.

02:01:22.817 --> 02:01:23.817
Good.

02:01:23.985 --> 02:01:25.976
They are not tearing it down.

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:28.729
I bought this building.

02:01:30.784 --> 02:01:32.695
And that building.

02:01:33.536 --> 02:01:35.277
And that one over there.

02:01:36.498 --> 02:01:37.784
This will be the first

02:01:37.874 --> 02:01:40.206
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:44.123
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

02:01:44.881 --> 02:01:46.121
And you will spearhead

02:01:46.216 --> 02:01:48.378
the science
and information exchange.

02:01:49.093 --> 02:01:51.050
You're kidding.

02:01:51.429 --> 02:01:52.715
Eh?

02:02:01.981 --> 02:02:03.016
Oh...

02:02:03.107 --> 02:02:06.020
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?

02:02:06.194 --> 02:02:07.901
That's like
a Bugatti spaceship!

02:02:08.071 --> 02:02:10.654
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

02:02:13.785 --> 02:02:14.946
What?

02:02:16.788 --> 02:02:17.788
Check it out, bro.

02:02:17.956 --> 02:02:19.321
We can take this back
to the house.

02:02:20.625 --> 02:02:21.706
Pull up to school in this.

02:02:21.793 --> 02:02:23.750
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

02:02:23.837 --> 02:02:24.837
On eBay.

02:02:24.921 --> 02:02:26.148
Everybody get, like,
a million apiece.

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:27.483
I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

02:02:27.507 --> 02:02:28.692
- Where you come from?
- From Wakanda.

02:02:28.716 --> 02:02:29.831
What is a Wakanda?

02:02:29.926 --> 02:02:30.926
KID 5; Hey, yo!

02:02:31.636 --> 02:02:32.842
This yours?

02:02:36.641 --> 02:02:37.972
Who...

02:02:38.351 --> 02:02:39.512
Who are you?

02:05:25.518 --> 02:05:27.680
<i>My name is King T'Challa...</i>

02:05:27.854 --> 02:05:29.970
<i>son of King T'Chaka.</i>

02:05:30.148 --> 02:05:34.483
<i>I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.</i>

02:05:34.652 --> 02:05:37.394
<i>And for the first time
in our history...</i>

02:05:37.572 --> 02:05:40.781
<i>we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...</i>

02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:42.816
<i>with the outside world.</i>

02:05:42.994 --> 02:05:46.362
<i>Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.</i>

02:05:46.539 --> 02:05:47.950
<i>We cannot.</i>

02:05:49.083 --> 02:05:50.573
<i>We must not.</i>

02:05:50.918 --> 02:05:53.535
<i>We will work to be an example
of how we...</i>

02:05:53.713 --> 02:05:55.954
<i>as brothers and sisters
on this earth...</i>

02:05:56.132 --> 02:05:58.169
<i>should treat each other.</i>

02:05:58.342 --> 02:06:00.174
<i>Now, more than ever...</i>

02:06:01.429 --> 02:06:05.844
<i>the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.</i>

02:06:06.267 --> 02:06:08.178
<i>We all know the truth.</i>

02:06:08.352 --> 02:06:11.765
<i>More connects us
than separates us.</i>

02:06:11.939 --> 02:06:13.646
<i>But in times of crisis...</i>

02:06:13.816 --> 02:06:16.274
<i>the wise build bridges...</i>

02:06:16.444 --> 02:06:19.232
<i>while the foolish
build barriers.</i>

02:06:19.405 --> 02:06:21.442
<i>We must find a way...</i>

02:06:21.616 --> 02:06:24.233
<i>to look after one another...</i>

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:29.120
<i>as if we were one,
single tribe.</i>

02:06:29.290 --> 02:06:30.770
<i>With all due respect,
King T'Challa...</i>

02:06:30.917 --> 02:06:32.157
<i>what can a nation of farmers</i>

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:34.117
<i>have to offer
the rest of the world?</i>

02:13:33.714 --> 02:13:35.705
Are you playing around
with that man again?

02:13:35.799 --> 02:13:37.079
- No.
- You're teasing him again.

02:13:38.219 --> 02:13:40.335
- Don't wake him. He must rest.
- No, I'm not.

02:13:41.305 --> 02:13:42.670
No, I'm not.

02:13:43.641 --> 02:13:44.881
Thabo,
you're doing that.

02:13:45.017 --> 02:13:46.382
He's doing it.
He's lying.

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:47.971
No, he's resting.

02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:49.476
Go, go!

02:13:49.647 --> 02:13:51.433
White Wolf!

02:13:51.565 --> 02:13:52.709
Stop that!

02:13:52.733 --> 02:13:53.853
White Wolf!

02:13:56.612 --> 02:13:58.292
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:00.740
Bucky.

02:14:02.368 --> 02:14:03.403
How are you feeling?

02:14:04.036 --> 02:14:05.036
Good.

02:14:07.665 --> 02:14:08.746
Thank you.

02:14:08.832 --> 02:14:10.368
Come.

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:13.743
Much more for you to learn.
