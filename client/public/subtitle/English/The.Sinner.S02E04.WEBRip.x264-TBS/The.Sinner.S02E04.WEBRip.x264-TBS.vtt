00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.436
Whatever's going on in Mosswood,

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:03.703
Julian's in the thick of it.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.239
When a boy that young kills,

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.241
it's really never just his fault.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.044
That whole Niagara Falls story,
you giving permission.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.078
That wasn't true.
You knew that that couple

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:15.014
wasn't coming back
to Mosswood with your son.

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.383
Memorize this number.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.154
You need anything, give me a call.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.422
- You must be Harry.
- Yeah.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.991
Glen Fisher, heard all about you.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.293
Heavy metal and tear gas.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.027
It worked at Waco.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.731
I talked to the judge,
and he's ordered an MHE

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:34.033
psychological evaluation.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.501
So why did you give her the tea?

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.538
- Because she lied.
- And what happens when you do?

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.739
You split in two.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.243
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, it's okay.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.246
Detective, she's not the mother.

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.382
My friend, Marin,
the one who went into Mosswood.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.151
I took your advice, and I followed up.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.321
Look what I found.
Julian, it's everywhere.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.524
So you were the attending
doctor at Julian's birth?

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.494
Not at it, I was... I was
called in for the paperwork.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.463
Dr. Poole? Oh, my God.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.768
I need to show you something.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:32.027

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:39.033
"Every day, I search for an
escape from the labyrinth.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:43.404
"Every day, the Minotaur hunts me.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.882
"Running only gives the bull more power.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:51.512
"The only way out is inward.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:55.549
"I must accept that at the
center of the labyrinth,

00:01:55.581 --> 00:02:00.119
"I will not face the Minotaur,
but myself.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.558
"I am the Minotaur.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:08.275
I am hunting myself."

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.266
Well, he certainly sounds devoted.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.200
Yeah.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.338
Devoted enough to kill himself
instead of talking.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.276
I wonder if there's more out there.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.044
More of what?

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.181
More like him.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.120
Who's this?

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.342
It's only a dream.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.914
It's not real. I promise you.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.651
I can't tell what's real.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.258
Did the test like you said.

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.330
When can I go home?

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.601
The test didn't go like we planned.

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:22.670
They have some more questions now.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:26.479
About what?

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:29.709
About you.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.882
About whether you're healthy, mentally.

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.617
Which we both know is ridiculous,

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.652
but that's what they think.

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:42.135
It just makes our self-defense plea

00:03:42.168 --> 00:03:44.845
a little more difficult, but it's okay.

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:46.966
One minute, folks.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.968
- I'm never going home, am I?
- Yes, you are.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.426
I'm going to get you out of here.

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:04.599
- Julian, look at me.
- No.

00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:06.534
There is nothing wrong with you.

00:04:06.568 --> 00:04:08.403
You are exactly the way
you're supposed to be.

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.471
You can't ever forget that.

00:04:10.504 --> 00:04:12.874
But you can't get me out.

00:04:12.907 --> 00:04:14.476
That's not true.

00:04:15.677 --> 00:04:17.845
Nothing on Mosswood anywhere.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.161
If he treated patients there,
maybe it was off the record.

00:04:21.883 --> 00:04:24.820
So I ran a check on his
physician's license number.

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:28.202
- And?
- Spotless record.

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:29.590
Except for one complaint

00:04:29.624 --> 00:04:31.559
to the state medical board 15 years ago.

00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:32.828
What kind of complaint?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.896
Malpractice suit that went nowhere.

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:37.432
It was filed by a Carmen Bell.

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:39.601
- Do we have an address?
- Yeah.

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:41.602
1 Brunswick Drive.

00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:45.908
That's Deakins Psychiatric Institute.

00:04:57.886 --> 00:05:00.722
It looks like it started in the kitchen.

00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:02.624
You see what happened?

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:07.896
My mom was cooking dinner on the stove.

00:06:03.684 --> 00:06:05.720
This is usually my nap.

00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:07.922
We won't keep you.

00:06:07.956 --> 00:06:09.658
We just want to ask you a few questions

00:06:09.691 --> 00:06:12.147
about Dr. Sheldon Poole.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.932
Um, you filed a malpractice
suit in 2002, is that right?

00:06:18.217 --> 00:06:20.953
I don't want to talk about Dr. Sheldon.

00:06:22.937 --> 00:06:25.773
- Can I ask why not?
- Because they changed my meds,

00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:28.509
and I'm tired,
and this is usually my nap.

00:06:31.278 --> 00:06:34.548
So now, what do they have you on?

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.379
Is it Seroquel?

00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:41.426
- And Risperidone.
- Mm.

00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:47.662
God, yeah, for years,
my mother was on that lithium.

00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:51.966
Mm, lithium's the worst.
Swells your ankles.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.014
Gives you nightmares.

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:57.872
There was a lot of that
when she lived here.

00:06:59.006 --> 00:07:04.780
She lived up on the 4th floor.
Up until 1975.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.790
I was sent to Dr. Sheldon by
the people I was living with.

00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:17.959
I guess you could call it a commune.

00:07:17.992 --> 00:07:19.839
Mosswood Grove?

00:07:20.595 --> 00:07:22.664
Yeah, how did you know that?

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:25.566
I think it's the only one around here.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.838
Why did they send you to a doctor?

00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:34.009
It was supposed to be
just a simple abortion,

00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:36.078
but he took the whole uterus.

00:07:38.312 --> 00:07:41.882
I'm sorry, he removed your uterus?

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:45.119
And when I complained about it,

00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:46.987
he came up with all this paperwork

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:50.057
saying that I had
consented to the surgery.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.129
So then, what did you do?

00:07:54.162 --> 00:07:57.599
I went to the police. I gave a deposition

00:07:57.631 --> 00:08:01.769
and everything, and that's when
things started happening.

00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:04.105
- What do you mean?
- People were following me,

00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:07.775
going through my things,
shooting words into my head.

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:09.811
- Who? Who was following you?
- All of them.

00:08:09.843 --> 00:08:12.646
The judge, the DA, my mom, my dad.

00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:14.583
Everyone, everybody.

00:08:14.615 --> 00:08:16.584
Once they deem you a danger to yourself,

00:08:16.617 --> 00:08:18.286
it's basically a free-for-all.

00:08:22.155 --> 00:08:24.992
Carmen, um...

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:27.795
Do you recognize...

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:32.833
This girl?

00:08:41.108 --> 00:08:43.177
A lot of girls came through Mosswood.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.946
A lot of guys too.
Chewed up and spat out.

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:47.815
Did you see this girl?

00:08:51.218 --> 00:08:53.088
You should look in the lake.

00:08:56.123 --> 00:08:57.625
Lake?

00:08:57.659 --> 00:08:59.928
They called it the purple lake.

00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:07.901
- Um, the purple lake?
- Yeah.

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:09.771
The Beacon, he liked to surround himself

00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:12.940
with pretty things,
but he got bored really easily.

00:09:12.973 --> 00:09:15.209
What was that name? The Beacon?

00:09:15.798 --> 00:09:16.977
Who was he?

00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.747
He's the one who
planted the eggs in my brain.

00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:24.119
Huh.

00:09:31.092 --> 00:09:32.894
Is this the Beacon?

00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:42.771
Can I keep this?

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:45.140
- Um, sorry, it's evidence.
- Please, please, please.

00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:47.075
They don't let me have anything.

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:49.209
- I can't have...
- Please, please.

00:09:49.242 --> 00:09:51.212
- We can arrange... um...
- Give it, please.

00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:55.850
- Miss Bell...
- Please, please, please!

00:09:55.882 --> 00:09:59.753
- Please, please, please, please!
- Okay.

00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:02.891
Carmen, calm down.

00:10:24.843 --> 00:10:27.945
We need to follow up on her deposition.

00:10:27.978 --> 00:10:31.223
See if we can back up
anything that she says.

00:10:31.782 --> 00:10:33.725
You don't believe her.

00:10:34.453 --> 00:10:37.395
Just thinking about
those eggs in her brain.

00:10:37.855 --> 00:10:39.991
Vera's left a voicemail.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.329
Well, play it.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.032
Okay.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.469
It's Vera. I was thinking
about what you said

00:10:50.502 --> 00:10:53.593
the other day and I think
I found something.

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:54.979
I want to show it to you

00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:56.832
before I show it to anybody else.

00:10:57.333 --> 00:10:59.035
Can you come by tomorrow morning?

00:10:59.069 --> 00:11:01.380
It's important, thanks.

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:04.742
She's trying to rope you in.

00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:07.678
Yeah, probably.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.647
We need to go hard at her.
Confront her about Marin.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.751
- Force a DNA test.
- No, no.

00:11:13.784 --> 00:11:16.453
If she feels better
being in control, fine.

00:11:16.486 --> 00:11:18.355
Let her be in control.

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:19.990
I need to get in there.

00:11:22.758 --> 00:11:26.695
Don't worry, we're going to
find out about your friend.

00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:30.034
All the movies here suck.

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:31.634
None of this is scary.

00:11:31.668 --> 00:11:34.538
It's like a manufactured dopamine rush

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.739
to make you think you're having
a real experience,

00:11:36.772 --> 00:11:39.142
when actually, you're just sitting there

00:11:39.175 --> 00:11:42.478
- getting brainwashed.
- Here we go.

00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:45.082
Just look at Rudy.

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:48.518
He just sits there, watching MSNBC,

00:11:48.551 --> 00:11:51.354
counting his cigarettes every night.

00:11:51.387 --> 00:11:53.189
He's a zombie,
and he doesn't even know it.

00:11:53.223 --> 00:11:54.724
Can we just chill?

00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:58.362
Have a normal night,
and not have everything

00:11:58.395 --> 00:12:02.772
be turned into some diatribe
against society?

00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:05.736
In Mosswood, they call it "resisting,"

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:07.438
what you just did.

00:12:10.774 --> 00:12:13.110
I don't want to talk to you
about that place.

00:12:13.142 --> 00:12:16.112
- It's a sign of unhappiness.
- I'm unhappy?

00:12:16.146 --> 00:12:19.650
Yeah, because you lie.

00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:21.117
I lie?

00:12:21.151 --> 00:12:23.753
You lie to yourself every day.

00:12:25.821 --> 00:12:27.090
About what?

00:12:33.262 --> 00:12:37.044
Marin, can't we just
make this a fun night?

00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:39.347
Look.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.607
- Did you steal that?
- Maybe.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.065
Hey.

00:12:45.508 --> 00:12:49.193
- Hey, Mr. Fireman.
- What are you girls up to?

00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:55.186
You guys have anything to mix this with?

00:12:58.255 --> 00:12:59.790
Don't do this to yourself, Tom.

00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:01.725
You're going to regret it.
Do not sign off on this.

00:13:01.757 --> 00:13:04.228
Have a seat, we were just having a chat

00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:06.163
about your pal, Harry Ambrose.

00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:08.699
This guy likes to pick apart
slam dunk cases.

00:13:08.732 --> 00:13:11.267
It's a sickness. He's got to go.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.170
- Excuse me?
- Look, he took apart this case

00:13:13.203 --> 00:13:14.704
against Cora Tannetti last year,

00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:17.141
and now, I hear he's been
hounding Judge Emerson

00:13:17.174 --> 00:13:20.177
to punt Julian Walker
back down to family court.

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:22.713
With all due respect,
maybe that's where he belongs.

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:24.561
That's my decision, not yours.

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.063
Certainly not his.

00:13:26.095 --> 00:13:27.583
But if my constituents want to see

00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:30.187
this Walker kid get time,
that's what's going to happen.

00:13:30.219 --> 00:13:31.821
Well, in that case,
maybe it's a good idea

00:13:31.854 --> 00:13:33.456
that Ambrose is around.

00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:35.892
As an outsider, he'll help make things

00:13:35.925 --> 00:13:39.229
at least seem impartial.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.900
I'd hate for your office
to be accused of bias.

00:13:45.334 --> 00:13:48.738
Tom, put a leash on this guy
before he does any real damage.

00:13:52.842 --> 00:13:55.779
- I know, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

00:13:57.213 --> 00:13:58.848
He's an asshole.

00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:00.684
I'm just thinking about your career.

00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:03.187
You have a lot of years
ahead of you in this county.

00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:05.655
Don't screw it up.

00:14:09.258 --> 00:14:11.294
What was the name
on that deposition tape?

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:13.764
Bell, it's Carmen Bell.

00:14:13.796 --> 00:14:15.731
That is strange,
you are the second person

00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:17.234
in two days looking for this tape.

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:18.734
Really?

00:14:18.767 --> 00:14:20.237
I couldn't tell you who he was, though.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.340
- He didn't sign in.
- What did he look like?

00:14:23.372 --> 00:14:25.776
He was a very thin man.

00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:35.818
He took it.

00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:20.261
- Hello?
- This is Julian.

00:15:21.262 --> 00:15:24.968
Julian, hey. How's it going?

00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:26.770
How you doing in there?

00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:29.840
My mother doesn't think
that I should talk to you.

00:15:29.872 --> 00:15:33.576
Well, she's probably
just being protective.

00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:37.848
Mothers, you know, they tend
to get that way sometimes.

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:40.884
I don't think that
she can get me out of her.

00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:44.854
She says that she can,
but I don't believe her.

00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:49.325
Uh, she's doing the best
she can, I tell you that.

00:15:49.358 --> 00:15:51.394
We all are.

00:15:51.428 --> 00:15:54.030
She won't tell me how long
I'm going to be in here.

00:15:57.766 --> 00:16:00.737
Okay, you've been charged with two counts

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.405
of second degree murder,

00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:07.444
and that carries a sentence
of 15 to 25 years each.

00:16:07.477 --> 00:16:08.812
So...

00:16:11.414 --> 00:16:15.952
The earliest I can leave
is in... 30 years?

00:16:16.651 --> 00:16:19.055
No, no, that's just, uh...

00:16:19.088 --> 00:16:21.925
I think your lawyer's going
to do a lot better than that.

00:16:24.694 --> 00:16:26.661
Can you be my lawyer?

00:16:27.664 --> 00:16:29.665
Um...

00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:31.669
No, I, uh...

00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:35.671
I can't be your lawyer.

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.708
That's not how it works.

00:16:39.843 --> 00:16:42.779
- I got to go.
- Call me back.

00:16:43.224 --> 00:16:45.160
Hey, Julian...

00:16:51.954 --> 00:16:54.857
- Hello.
- Hey.

00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:56.360
Please leave your gun and your phone

00:16:56.392 --> 00:16:57.928
and your badge in your car.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.063
You have to come in like everybody else.

00:17:00.095 --> 00:17:01.364
Strip down.

00:17:25.142 --> 00:17:26.778
Julian is with me.

00:17:28.912 --> 00:17:31.182
I'm holding him.

00:17:31.214 --> 00:17:33.783
Inside my pouch.

00:17:33.817 --> 00:17:37.488
I can feel his whole weight inside of me.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.892
I'm so happy.

00:17:41.924 --> 00:17:45.695
Hold it. So who is this?

00:17:45.729 --> 00:17:47.465
Bess McTeer.

00:17:49.232 --> 00:17:51.601
But Julian won't stop crying.

00:17:51.634 --> 00:17:53.671
Why is he crying?

00:17:53.703 --> 00:17:57.575
Because they're going to find us.

00:17:57.607 --> 00:18:02.679
So I put my hand over his face
just to quiet him,

00:18:02.712 --> 00:18:06.951
and he stops breathing.

00:18:16.827 --> 00:18:19.696
So what was that? A dream?

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.276
A fantasy.

00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:24.868
Bess was unable to have children.

00:18:24.902 --> 00:18:27.572
It became a defining issue for her.

00:18:28.638 --> 00:18:29.906
I didn't want to see it at the time,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.741
but it's clear to me now
that she developed

00:18:31.775 --> 00:18:34.122
an unhealthy attachment to Julian.

00:18:34.744 --> 00:18:37.751
So she took him.
That's what you're saying?

00:18:38.582 --> 00:18:40.718
Julian knew he was being abducted.

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:43.753
He acted in self-defense.

00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:48.291
Why do you have that recording?

00:18:48.325 --> 00:18:50.661
It's a session. The work.

00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:53.998
- You record all the sessions?
- Only with permission.

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:56.733
Did you do that stuff to Julian?

00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:00.738
With Julian.

00:19:02.873 --> 00:19:04.642
I don't know if we can take

00:19:04.674 --> 00:19:06.743
any of this seriously as evidence.

00:19:06.777 --> 00:19:08.746
We have to have
a lot better understanding

00:19:08.779 --> 00:19:10.814
of what these sessions are all about.

00:19:10.846 --> 00:19:12.616
I told you, it's therapy.

00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:17.821
Can I observe a session?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.403
That's not possible. It's confidential.

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:23.961
Can you do it with me?

00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:27.176
Now?

00:19:29.094 --> 00:19:30.634
Yeah.

00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:39.143
As requested, all the lakes
in a 25 mile radius

00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:41.110
of Mosswood Grove.

00:19:41.144 --> 00:19:44.192
- All 42 of them.
- Thank you.

00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:48.152
You get this from Carmen Bell?

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:49.781
Yeah?

00:19:51.154 --> 00:19:53.744
What are we looking for, exactly?

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:55.893
I'm not sure.

00:20:40.703 --> 00:20:41.838
Hey.

00:20:46.615 --> 00:20:48.284
What's wrong?

00:20:48.944 --> 00:20:50.615
What am I doing?

00:20:52.066 --> 00:20:53.368
What do you mean?

00:20:55.885 --> 00:20:57.087
I'm just...

00:20:58.689 --> 00:20:59.923
Here.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.434
- Running around like a loser.
- What, no.

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:09.799
You're not a loser.

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:13.237
You're going to college
next year, you have a plan.

00:21:14.028 --> 00:21:15.897
What am I going to do?

00:21:19.175 --> 00:21:24.013
I'm living at my dad's
and commuting to Syracuse.

00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:26.488
I'm going to see you all the time.

00:21:27.962 --> 00:21:29.731
Nothing's going to change.

00:21:33.154 --> 00:21:34.289
Hey.

00:21:57.847 --> 00:22:00.151
We said we weren't
going to do that anymore.

00:22:03.819 --> 00:22:04.954
Sorry.

00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:10.094
Forget it.

00:22:10.126 --> 00:22:11.494
Well, it's a little hard to forget it

00:22:11.528 --> 00:22:13.550
when it's there all the time.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.498
- What are you talking about?
- You're doing it again.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.936
- What?
- You're lying to yourself!

00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:25.275
Where are you going?

00:22:26.843 --> 00:22:28.211
Marin!

00:22:47.973 --> 00:22:50.409
200 years ago, a Pentecostal tent revival

00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:53.011
was build right here
with the rock in the middle.

00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:54.912
And before that, the Seneca believed

00:22:54.946 --> 00:22:56.881
that a man and a woman were locked inside

00:22:56.915 --> 00:22:59.471
as a punishment for breaking their vows.

00:23:00.084 --> 00:23:02.688
So now what does it mean to you?

00:23:03.688 --> 00:23:06.825
All I know is that I feel
better when I'm close to it.

00:23:08.025 --> 00:23:10.295
It's like something from a dream.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.967
Julian told me about some of his dreams.

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:17.902
- I know.
- About some kind of monster

00:23:17.936 --> 00:23:21.674
- that visits him at night.
- The old hag.

00:23:21.707 --> 00:23:24.310
- That a fairy tale?
- It's an archetype.

00:23:24.342 --> 00:23:27.513
They exist in some form
in cultures all over the world.

00:23:27.545 --> 00:23:31.417
Usually, she appears
as an old woman in a cloak.

00:23:31.449 --> 00:23:33.419
She sneaks into your room at night,

00:23:33.451 --> 00:23:35.453
and sits on your chest.

00:23:36.921 --> 00:23:39.057
Have you ever been visited by her?

00:23:41.793 --> 00:23:43.390
No.

00:23:43.862 --> 00:23:45.183
Are you sure?

00:23:47.498 --> 00:23:49.968
You were going to show me the work.

00:23:54.773 --> 00:23:56.342
This way.

00:24:19.163 --> 00:24:20.969
Hey.

00:24:21.499 --> 00:24:24.001
Hey.

00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:26.971
- What the hell happened?
- I'm sorry.

00:24:28.407 --> 00:24:31.377
It's okay. I'm glad you called.

00:24:32.777 --> 00:24:35.881
- Where's Marin?
- She's gone.

00:24:35.913 --> 00:24:38.850
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

00:24:38.883 --> 00:24:41.487
All right, let's go find her.

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:44.122
Come on, here we go.

00:25:01.072 --> 00:25:02.440
Marin?

00:25:03.941 --> 00:25:05.577
Marin.

00:25:08.546 --> 00:25:11.015
Stop, damn it.

00:25:16.086 --> 00:25:18.089
Marin, God damn it.

00:25:19.157 --> 00:25:21.025
It's 2:00 in the goddamn morning.

00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:23.561
You know I can't leave you out here.

00:25:23.594 --> 00:25:24.896
What is going on?

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:31.969
How's life in the weeds?

00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:35.608
Oh, it just never ends. It's Sisyphean.

00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:39.577
What brings you out on a school day?

00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:43.916
It's not public yet, but um...

00:25:44.983 --> 00:25:47.519
It's possible that Marin
might actually be the mother

00:25:47.552 --> 00:25:49.154
of the kid we arrested.

00:25:49.187 --> 00:25:51.223
Marin, really?

00:25:51.256 --> 00:25:53.025
Do you remember the night
that she ran off

00:25:53.057 --> 00:25:55.126
and joined Mosswood?

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.161
And we were driving around
trying to find her?

00:25:57.195 --> 00:25:58.964
You mean the night you drank enough rum

00:25:58.996 --> 00:26:00.565
to flood a small fishing village?

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:02.568
Yeah, I remember.

00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:04.969
Do you remember what
she said to you that night?

00:26:05.003 --> 00:26:07.005
Oh, honey, I...

00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:09.974
I can't remember last week,
are you kidding?

00:26:10.007 --> 00:26:11.977
Come inside... let's get some iced tea.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.014
Marin, Jesus.

00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:17.949
I can't be her friend anymore.

00:26:17.983 --> 00:26:21.653
- Don't say that.
- I'm serious.

00:26:21.686 --> 00:26:23.889
She's the one who changed, not me.

00:26:25.623 --> 00:26:27.159
What is that?

00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:30.895
What, did you guys get drunk
and get tattoos?

00:26:30.929 --> 00:26:35.500
Um, this is something
they draw at Mosswood.

00:26:35.534 --> 00:26:37.203
It's a labyrinth.

00:26:39.638 --> 00:26:41.139
It doesn't look like a labyrinth.

00:26:41.171 --> 00:26:44.043
Because you have to use your imagination.

00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:52.150
Hold on.

00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:57.555
That's it.

00:26:59.658 --> 00:27:00.993
Right?

00:27:02.694 --> 00:27:03.729
You get it?

00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:12.204
I don't know what it means.

00:27:12.237 --> 00:27:15.306
- Did she say anything else?
- Nope.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.977
You guys were both so trashed.

00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:21.079
It wasn't long after Mom died.

00:27:23.047 --> 00:27:24.715
A couple of years.

00:27:24.748 --> 00:27:28.019
I think I was still messed up over that.

00:27:31.022 --> 00:27:32.625
You too, probably?

00:27:33.958 --> 00:27:35.561
It was a long time ago.

00:27:38.729 --> 00:27:40.198
You hear that?

00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:46.104
Weeds calling me. Bye.

00:27:51.775 --> 00:27:55.279
Tell me about your daughter.
Are you two close?

00:27:55.313 --> 00:27:56.893
Sure.

00:27:57.381 --> 00:27:59.771
You don't sound so sure.

00:28:00.084 --> 00:28:04.121
Oh, it's just we haven't
gotten to talk much lately.

00:28:04.154 --> 00:28:06.324
- That's all.
- Why not?

00:28:06.358 --> 00:28:08.027
Oh, just because.

00:28:09.393 --> 00:28:11.362
You're very good
at quarantining yourself,

00:28:11.396 --> 00:28:12.631
aren't you?

00:28:14.733 --> 00:28:16.669
Lifelong practice?

00:28:17.736 --> 00:28:22.239
Now, is that part of the work
that you're doing with Julian?

00:28:22.273 --> 00:28:23.775
Prodding a little bit,

00:28:23.807 --> 00:28:25.810
and forcing him to answer your questions?

00:28:25.843 --> 00:28:27.979
I don't force anyone.

00:28:28.013 --> 00:28:31.717
Well, he's a kid, so it's
hardly like he has a choice.

00:28:31.749 --> 00:28:37.722
This work, it's all about
invitation, not confrontation.

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:40.257
Julian certainly benefits from it.

00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:43.195
Maybe, up until recently.

00:28:46.331 --> 00:28:48.132
There's your cruel streak.

00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:50.102
I knew it was in there somewhere.

00:28:50.134 --> 00:28:52.199
I do get cranky.

00:28:52.804 --> 00:28:54.406
Listening to analysis

00:28:54.438 --> 00:28:57.708
while we're
wandering around in the woods.

00:28:57.742 --> 00:28:59.745
You like to be in control?

00:28:59.777 --> 00:29:01.746
You know something about that?

00:29:03.681 --> 00:29:05.416
This way.

00:29:05.449 --> 00:29:07.052
Okay.

00:29:12.157 --> 00:29:16.194
Hey, Vera!

00:29:27.772 --> 00:29:29.341
Vera?

00:29:38.115 --> 00:29:39.684
Vera?

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:33.298
You mentioned on the phone
that you had a copy

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.299
of the book "Escaping the Labyrinth."

00:30:35.332 --> 00:30:38.269
That's right. Uh, Lionel Jeffries.

00:30:38.302 --> 00:30:40.338
Yeah, we ran one printing of that

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:43.909
back in 1987, I want to say.

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:47.980
- Before the controversy.
- What controversy?

00:30:48.012 --> 00:30:49.914
He was a psychotherapist in Canada.

00:30:49.947 --> 00:30:53.184
Had quite the devout
little following until

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.922
these allegations of physical
abuse and sexual abuse.

00:30:56.954 --> 00:31:00.324
It's a shame; the book itself
is actually quite interesting.

00:31:00.357 --> 00:31:02.094
How so?

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:05.196
His whole thing was about
a return to ritual.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.485
Symbolic play, and re-enacting trauma.

00:31:08.517 --> 00:31:10.451
That sort of thing,
so you can see how that

00:31:10.483 --> 00:31:12.370
could easily go off the rails.

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:17.041
- Where is he now?
- That is a good question.

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:22.347
Uh, after he lost his license
in the 90s, he disappeared.

00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:25.049
Oh, there it is.
Somebody ordered it last month,

00:31:25.082 --> 00:31:27.318
and it was sent back as undeliverable.

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:35.093
Can I see that envelope?

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:44.435
Self storage, Niagara Falls.

00:31:47.504 --> 00:31:49.974
Can I keep this?

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:40.959
Whoever was renting this unit paid cash.

00:32:40.991 --> 00:32:42.360
They stopped paying last month.

00:32:42.394 --> 00:32:44.462
I was about to start clearing it out.

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:46.998
Looks like somebody was living here.

00:33:01.578 --> 00:33:04.450
These are all kid's clothes.

00:33:22.466 --> 00:33:24.368
What's the name on the agreement?

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:26.372
Uh, let's see.

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:30.975
Walker, Julian.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.067
Tell me what you see.

00:34:00.003 --> 00:34:01.873
A pile of sand.

00:34:03.108 --> 00:34:05.177
What's in the pile of sand?

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:10.181
I see my father.

00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:15.387
I see my father.

00:34:18.123 --> 00:34:19.425
And then?

00:34:21.391 --> 00:34:23.393
What do you want to do?

00:35:39.453 --> 00:35:43.056
- There you are.
- What is all this, huh?

00:35:43.089 --> 00:35:44.891
What you think you're doing?

00:35:44.924 --> 00:35:46.726
Oh, don't leave the door wide open.

00:35:46.759 --> 00:35:48.795
I wandered around in the dark
for a little while,

00:35:48.828 --> 00:35:50.664
but I am on to you now.

00:35:50.697 --> 00:35:52.702
I knew you'd find your way.

00:35:53.299 --> 00:35:55.335
Make yourself at home.

00:35:55.368 --> 00:35:59.172
I don't think so.
I'm heading out of here.

00:35:59.205 --> 00:36:01.074
No, no, no. It's too late for that now.

00:36:01.107 --> 00:36:02.676
We'll go in the morning,
when it's light out.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.279
Hey, are you... are you
playing games with me?

00:36:05.312 --> 00:36:07.681
Is that it? Is that it, huh?

00:36:08.781 --> 00:36:11.885
Finally, there you are.

00:36:19.192 --> 00:36:20.661
You're limping.

00:36:22.862 --> 00:36:24.331
Sit down.

00:36:26.232 --> 00:36:27.435
Sit.

00:36:54.527 --> 00:36:57.864
It's swollen, and I don't have any ice.

00:37:20.453 --> 00:37:21.955
Too tight?

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.493
No.

00:37:29.263 --> 00:37:30.764
Don't move.

00:37:45.212 --> 00:37:48.783
- Who's on the mantle?
- The Beacon.

00:37:48.815 --> 00:37:49.984
He was the leader of Mosswood

00:37:50.016 --> 00:37:52.252
back when Mosswood had a leader.

00:37:52.286 --> 00:37:54.321
This is his cabin.

00:37:54.353 --> 00:37:56.790
What time is he expected home?

00:37:56.824 --> 00:37:58.459
He's gone now.

00:37:58.491 --> 00:38:00.493
But he did most of his
writing and meditating

00:38:00.527 --> 00:38:02.624
right here in this room.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.500
Green tea. Not Jimson Weed.

00:38:08.502 --> 00:38:10.337
This is where he developed the ideas

00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:12.801
I'm trying to pass on to my son.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.842
And those are what?

00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:18.444
Most of us spend our lives
trying to suppress

00:38:18.478 --> 00:38:21.382
the parts of ourselves
we deem inappropriate.

00:38:22.915 --> 00:38:25.218
We spend our lives trying to detach

00:38:25.252 --> 00:38:28.024
from all of that beautiful feeling.

00:38:28.554 --> 00:38:30.857
And it doesn't work, does it?

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.497
Julian is a new kind of man.

00:38:38.866 --> 00:38:40.467
At one with nature.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.007
Fluid with all of the darkness,
and all of the light.

00:38:47.507 --> 00:38:48.842
You're never going to show me

00:38:48.875 --> 00:38:51.011
what the work actually is, are you?

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.348
You've already been doing it.

00:38:56.549 --> 00:38:58.552
Can I ask you?

00:39:02.922 --> 00:39:05.926
Did your mother ever leave you
lost in the woods?

00:39:09.062 --> 00:39:11.364
I'm not here to talk about my mother.

00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:17.572
What are you feeling right now?

00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:20.373
Be honest.

00:39:23.911 --> 00:39:26.374
I don't trust you.

00:39:27.147 --> 00:39:28.918
That's fear.

00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:31.853
I'm scared, too.

00:39:34.054 --> 00:39:36.858
And a sexual pull, right here.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.331
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

00:39:44.364 --> 00:39:46.467
There's no way to know.

00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:50.972
What else?

00:39:55.107 --> 00:39:56.943
Anger.

00:39:58.978 --> 00:40:00.614
Rage.

00:40:03.616 --> 00:40:05.919
Oh...

00:40:14.427 --> 00:40:16.596
And underneath that rage,

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.400
if you could just taste what's there.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.536
What would it be?

00:40:52.165 --> 00:40:53.967
Mom?

00:40:55.634 --> 00:40:57.370
Mom?

00:41:11.685 --> 00:41:15.422
Oh, God, oh, God.
