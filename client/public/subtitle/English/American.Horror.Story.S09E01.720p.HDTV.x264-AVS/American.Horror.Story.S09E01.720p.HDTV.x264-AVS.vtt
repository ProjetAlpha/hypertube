- If it feels good, go with it.

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:14.955
But we're supposed
to be the responsible ones here.

00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:16.788
I got to agree with that.

00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:20.748
So, in the spirit of responsibility:

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.514
lambskins.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.524
What was that?

00:01:10.062 --> 00:01:13.031
I know you two heard it. The jingling?

00:01:13.032 --> 00:01:14.533
It's probably those annoying wind chimes

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:16.534
the eight-year-olds made.

00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:35.798
Rad bod, though.

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:37.799
Like that girl on Cheers.

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:41.104
I noticed you ogling
my buddy Chet's mound.

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:43.106
You want me to introduce you?

00:05:43.107 --> 00:05:45.207
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:47.043
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:05:47.044 --> 00:05:49.311
The whole reason most people
come to Slimmercise class

00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:50.412
is to hook up.

00:05:52.049 --> 00:05:53.615
Not for me.

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:55.951
The last American virgin.

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.620
Everyone tells me I can be

00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:59.721
a little over the top with new people.

00:05:59.722 --> 00:06:01.842
It's just that it's L.A....
you can't make friends

00:06:01.843 --> 00:06:03.525
unless you get a little
aggressive, right?

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:04.593
Totally.

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:06.095
I'm Brooke.

00:06:06.096 --> 00:06:07.163
I'm new in town.

00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:08.630
Well, I'm obsessed with this place.

00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.466
I've been doing aerobics since '82.

00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:13.202
Ever since I read those articles
about it in Rolling Stone.

00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:15.938
Did you know they have competitive
aerobics championships?

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.306
Sounds... serious.

00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:19.131
I know it may sound silly to you,

00:06:19.132 --> 00:06:21.991
but I'm gonna be the greatest
aerobics competitor of all time.

00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:23.926
- I'm Montana, by the way.
- Mm.

00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.421
She was stabbed, like, 40 times.

00:06:33.422 --> 00:06:36.792
Her throat was cut so badly
she was basically decapitated.

00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:39.427
- Describing your last date?
- Hilarious.

00:06:39.428 --> 00:06:41.060
- Yeah.
- No.

00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:43.832
There was a murder a couple
of days ago in Glassell Park.

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:46.334
My cousin works for LAPD Homicide,

00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:48.303
and they're convinced
whoever did it is responsible

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:50.939
for a bunch of other
unsolved murders in town.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.498
The cops are calling
him the Night Stalker.

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:55.576
I heard serial killers
become more active

00:06:55.577 --> 00:06:57.343
in the summer months when it's hot.

00:07:00.448 --> 00:07:02.774
Because people sleep with
their windows open at night.

00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:04.451
Hmm. This is Brooke.

00:07:04.452 --> 00:07:05.953
She's new in town.

00:07:05.954 --> 00:07:07.855
Brooke, this is Xavier,

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:09.824
Ray and Chet.

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:11.558
Hi.

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:13.460
Hey.

00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.263
Hey. How do you guys know each other?

00:07:16.264 --> 00:07:17.297
Well, it's L.A.

00:07:17.298 --> 00:07:18.890
Do any of us really know each other?

00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:21.540
We collected each other
over the last couple of years.

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.208
Xavier and Montana met in traffic

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.043
- and dated for a hot second.
- "Met in traffic"

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.212
is a nice way of saying
that I missed an audition

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:28.713
for one of the last episodes of MASH

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.215
because she rear-ended me.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:31.216
You are welcome.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:33.085
- You're an actor?
- Yeah.

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:35.420
Not one of those "happy to
get a role on a soap opera

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.256
or a Coca-Cola commercial" types.

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:39.424
I'm a serious actor.

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.459
I trained at Stella Adler...

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.061
I'm method.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:44.129
Cool.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.563
Chet and I met at the gym.

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:47.232
Yeah, and I think I met Montana

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.736
at a party up in the hills
at Justine Bateman's house.

00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:51.372
- You know her?
- Not really.

00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:53.674
Anyway... my cousin was
saying that they think

00:07:53.675 --> 00:07:55.442
that this guy's gonna go on a rampage,

00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:58.179
like Son of Sam did
in the summer of '78.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.181
Which is why I'm getting out of town

00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:01.549
for the next couple of months.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.441
I got a gig as a counselor
at a summer camp

00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:05.409
they're opening up a
couple of hours from here.

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:08.112
You guys should all come.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.880
I mean, they're
desperate for counselors.

00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:12.192
Hey, I'm in. When do we leave?

00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:14.130
Tomorrow, after class.

00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:15.465
Why can't we leave tonight?

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:17.300
Slow down.

00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:18.904
What's with you?

00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:20.739
You been jumpy all week.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.875
I'm just ready to get out before
the Olympic shit show starts.

00:08:23.876 --> 00:08:26.711
Okay? Los Angeles is about
to descend into chaos.

00:08:26.712 --> 00:08:29.047
All right, gridlock on the freeways.

00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:30.882
And I'm thinking of poor
Chet, having to be here

00:08:30.883 --> 00:08:32.551
getting his face rubbed in it.

00:08:32.552 --> 00:08:34.385
Fuck the IOC.

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:36.587
I'm in.

00:08:36.588 --> 00:08:38.722
Do you think they'd let
me teach aerobics up there?

00:08:38.723 --> 00:08:40.958
Can't see why not.

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:42.793
I'm in.

00:08:42.794 --> 00:08:44.428
You should come.

00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:46.296
I'm desperate for some
estrogen in this crew.

00:08:46.297 --> 00:08:48.799
Oh. Sounds fun,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.959
but I'm taking classes
at Santa Monica College.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.237
I'm gonna be a veterinary assistant.

00:08:54.238 --> 00:08:56.406
Wow. Aiming high.

00:08:56.407 --> 00:08:58.798
Knock it off, Montana.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.799
Yeah.

00:09:00.896 --> 00:09:02.613
I'm in the medical field, too.

00:09:02.614 --> 00:09:03.844
Medical field?

00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:06.346
You're an orderly. You mop up poop.

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:08.181
We're all putting our
lives on hold for this,

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:11.181
but I'm telling you,
it's gonna be worth it.

00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:13.085
You don't want to be in
this town this summer.

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:14.754

Face it: you're a badass.

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:12.994

Brooke, you're totally doing

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:31.484
Absolutely. It's gonna

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:36.455
I got enough blow and weed
to last us through the summer.

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.390
And let's just hope
we don't have to take

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.059
any random drug tests.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.019

.001. That's how much shit

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.999
those wastoids say
was in my bloodstream.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.500
If you haven't figured it out,

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.135
Chet was disqualified from Team USA.

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.738
He peed a pharmacy, so they
kicked him out of the Olympics.

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:55.241
Come on, you can be honest
with us... we're friends.

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:56.742
But I didn't do anything!

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:59.077
I worked my ass off for that spot.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.147
I mean, look at this bod.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:04.483
Have you ever seen a body like this?

00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:05.918
Never.

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:08.387
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Embarrassing myself?

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:10.221
- Yes.
- Yeah, what the hell have you got? Let's see.

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:11.790
Yeah, I'm up for a laugh.

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:17.429
Well, it's like the ad says...
there's always room for Jell-O.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.930

Hey, this is Xavier's answering machine.

00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:13.616
When you hear the beep, do your thang.

00:14:15.257 --> 00:14:17.591

You can't just take your dick

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:24.964
nowhere to hide.

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:27.467
I know exactly where you're going.

Xavier! Let's go! We got to get
moving if we're gonna make it

00:14:30.137 --> 00:14:31.905
to Redwood before dark.

00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:33.740
You say Redwood?

00:14:33.741 --> 00:14:35.642
Yeah. Camp Redwood.

00:14:35.643 --> 00:14:37.711
We're all counselors
there for the summer.

00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:39.279
Turn around.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.280
Go back to the city.

00:14:42.729 --> 00:14:44.897
They never should have
opened that place up again.

00:14:44.898 --> 00:14:47.166
Yeah, yeah. How much do we owe you?

00:14:47.167 --> 00:14:49.401
Ten even.

00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:00.777

Nah, that was a side road.

00:15:25.022 --> 00:15:26.727
Leads to the same place.

00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:28.069
This way is much faster.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.271
You've never been here before.

00:15:29.272 --> 00:15:31.039
- How do you know?
- Instincts, baby.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.068
Maybe we should have
checked at the gas station.

00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:35.177
Why was that guy saying

00:15:35.178 --> 00:15:37.045
all of that creepy st... Look out!

00:15:46.388 --> 00:15:48.189
Did we hit him?

00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:52.073
No. I-I don't think so.

00:15:52.074 --> 00:15:53.394
Hey.

00:15:53.395 --> 00:15:55.162
You okay?

00:15:56.547 --> 00:15:58.017
Just keep your head back and relax.

00:15:58.018 --> 00:15:59.233
We need to keep him warm.

00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:01.268
I-I'll go get a blanket.

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:02.601
What's your name?

00:16:03.638 --> 00:16:05.139
I can't remember.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.541
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:16:07.542 --> 00:16:10.044
- Don't move.
- No...

00:16:10.045 --> 00:16:11.378
Look-look at his cuts.

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:14.082
The dried blood. He didn't just get

00:16:14.083 --> 00:16:16.251
those injuries... he's
been out here a long time.

00:16:16.252 --> 00:16:18.854
Doesn't matter. We're
in the middle of nowhere.

00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:20.355
We can't just leave him here.

00:16:20.356 --> 00:16:22.715
We'll take him back
to the camp with us, then, but

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:24.883
let's get our stories straight.
We didn't hit him.

00:16:27.296 --> 00:16:29.120
Here, let's just get him up, huh?

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.883
- Let's get him up.
- Come on.

00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:33.934
You got to believe me.

00:16:33.935 --> 00:16:35.903
- I tried.
- It's okay.

00:16:35.904 --> 00:16:37.904
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.924
Hey.

00:16:43.925 --> 00:16:46.125
Hey!

00:17:09.975 --> 00:17:11.575
Welcome to Camp Redwood.

00:17:11.576 --> 00:17:13.577
I'm Margaret Booth. I'm the owner.

00:17:13.578 --> 00:17:16.071
Boss lady chopping her own wood. Choice.

00:17:16.072 --> 00:17:17.973
Well, we'll all have
to wear multiple hats.

00:17:17.974 --> 00:17:20.052
We are short-staffed, and the
kids arrive in the morning.

00:17:20.053 --> 00:17:22.050
Yeah, are we the only counselors?

00:17:22.051 --> 00:17:24.712
Well, the Olympics create
thousands of temporary jobs,

00:17:24.713 --> 00:17:27.028
and my pool of potential
employees was limited.

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:29.029
Is there a medic or a nurse here?

00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:32.552
We have a situation.

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:34.177
What happened to him?

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:36.134
Uh, he was by the side of the road.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.657
- He was already messed up.
- Okay, well,

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:39.991
let's get him to the infirmary.

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:50.002
You say you found him in
the middle of the road?

00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:51.637
He was by the side of the road.

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:54.640
He's been pretty out of
it, saying weird things,

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:56.275
not making much sense.

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:58.778
He's severely dehydrated.

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:01.247
Probably went for a hike and got lost.

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:04.350
Couldn't find his way back. Panicked.

00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.986
People don't realize just
how deep these woods are.

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:10.722
Hikers get lost in them every year.

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:13.024
End up dead of hypothermia or

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:14.492
falling into a ravine

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.828
or just disappearing altogether.

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:18.597
He's lucky you found him.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:19.655
Hmm.

00:18:19.656 --> 00:18:20.999
Is he gonna die?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.168
Not on my watch.

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:24.279
Don't worry,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.867
I work in the E.R. at Hawthorne
Hospital the rest of the year.

00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:29.407
Why don't we give our
nurse a little space.

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:31.842
Come on. I can show you
all a tour of the camp.

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.548
We have canoes and rowboats.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.985
All children must have a
buddy to go into the water.

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:42.344
The lake is allegedly bottomless,

00:18:42.345 --> 00:18:45.204
and drowning is the number one
cause of death for U.S. campers.

00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:46.205
What's second?

00:18:57.703 --> 00:19:00.405
And this is Chef Bertie,

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:02.139
a Camp Redwood veteran.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.608
Dibs.

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.042
You wouldn't know what to do with it

00:19:05.043 --> 00:19:06.277
if you got it, handsome.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.880
Put those scrawny arms to work

00:19:09.881 --> 00:19:11.882
and help a lady fill her pantry.

00:19:11.883 --> 00:19:13.884
All of you, grab a crate.

00:19:13.885 --> 00:19:16.053
This heat is a killer.

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.388
Chef Bertie worked here
when I was a counselor.

00:19:18.389 --> 00:19:21.025
We are so blessed to have her with us.

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:23.928
I have many good memories of this place.

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:26.462
It's magic up here in the fresh air.

00:19:28.153 --> 00:19:31.421
I'm sorry that one bad
apple ruined it for everyone.

00:19:31.422 --> 00:19:34.424
The minute I heard Margaret
was reopening this place,

00:19:34.425 --> 00:19:36.526
I was first to volunteer.

00:19:36.527 --> 00:19:39.763
No. No, no, no, this... all
this goes up to the mess hall.

00:19:39.764 --> 00:19:42.599
Girls shower in the a.m.,
boys in the p.m.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.268
Same goes for counselors, too.

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:47.103
This is the girls' cabin.

00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:53.776
And this is the boys' cabin.

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.111
Girls are red.

00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:56.479
Boys are blue.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.146
Don't even try to make purple.

00:19:59.183 --> 00:20:00.950
You expect us to be celibate all summer?

00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:02.919
Well, I'm not banning self-abuse.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.921
Although every stroke soils your soul.

00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:06.223
But how could I ever enforce it?

00:20:06.224 --> 00:20:08.558
It's 1984, Margaret.

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:11.127
They're building coed showers
in the West Hollywood gym.

00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:13.697
You ever hear of the sexual revolution?

00:20:13.698 --> 00:20:15.699
Sex won.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.735
I am aware of the decadence of our era.

00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:21.003
Women's underwear that
shows the buttocks.

00:20:21.004 --> 00:20:23.806
Pornography in your own home.

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.141
Van Halen.

00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:27.676
I have been fighting the Lord's fight

00:20:27.677 --> 00:20:30.212
against filth around
the world for years.

00:20:30.213 --> 00:20:32.522
Charles Keating is a dear friend.

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.548
I was right by his side in Cincinnati

00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:36.349
during that Larry Flynt trial.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.986
And that is why, while still grieving

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:42.056
my sweet husband
Walter's untimely death,

00:20:42.057 --> 00:20:45.459
I took a small portion
of the large fortune

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.395
he left to me to buy this
camp and create a safe,

00:20:48.396 --> 00:20:51.992
pure, godly and decent place

00:20:51.993 --> 00:20:55.396
for the children of this country
to escape for the summer.

00:20:55.397 --> 00:20:58.756
It is a dream come true.

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:01.676
Now, there aren't many rules,
but I expect every one of you

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.269
to follow them without exception.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.740
Who's Charles Keating?

00:21:33.434 --> 00:21:35.767
I don't smoke that funny weed.

00:21:35.768 --> 00:21:39.505
Only thing I put in my lungs...

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:40.772
is a Marlboro Red.

00:21:40.773 --> 00:21:42.708
You know that shit will kill you.

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:44.443
All got to die somehow.

00:21:44.444 --> 00:21:47.446
Any of you been camp counselors before?

00:21:47.447 --> 00:21:48.618
- Mm-mmm.
- No.

00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:50.051
Nah. We just had to get out of L.A.

00:21:50.052 --> 00:21:51.052
I hear that.

00:21:51.053 --> 00:21:52.511
Couldn't stand being in that city

00:21:52.512 --> 00:21:55.389
another minute. Not with
all those gruesome murders

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.024
happening so close to home.

00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:59.160
I was attacked in my apartment

00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:01.161
by the Night Stalker.

00:22:02.164 --> 00:22:04.341
He said he'd come after me.

00:22:04.342 --> 00:22:05.976
Brooke, take a chill pill.

00:22:05.977 --> 00:22:08.279
He doesn't know where you
are, and nobody followed us.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.014
Nothing bad is gonna happen here.

00:22:10.015 --> 00:22:13.016
Maybe not, but something did.

00:22:14.185 --> 00:22:15.719
14 years ago.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.754
That's why they closed this place down.

00:22:17.755 --> 00:22:21.015
Rita. I totally understand
the tradition,

00:22:21.016 --> 00:22:22.592
and usually I'm cool with that,

00:22:22.593 --> 00:22:24.694
but our friend Brooke here

00:22:24.695 --> 00:22:26.763
had a for-real assault, and

00:22:26.764 --> 00:22:29.099
we're just not in the mood
for a bullshit ghost story.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.500
It's not bullshit.

00:22:30.501 --> 00:22:32.535
And there was no ghost.

00:22:33.871 --> 00:22:35.872
I'll be honest with you.
I've never been a nurse

00:22:35.873 --> 00:22:37.241
at a summer camp before.

00:22:37.242 --> 00:22:39.576
And you've never been counselors.

00:22:39.577 --> 00:22:41.678
So how did we get these jobs

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:44.347
with no prior experience?

00:22:44.348 --> 00:22:46.516
That's because anybody
that knows anything

00:22:46.517 --> 00:22:47.918
about Camp Redwood

00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:50.385
doesn't want to be in Camp Redwood.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.891
This is the sight of the
worst summer camp massacre

00:22:54.892 --> 00:22:56.225
of all time.

00:22:56.226 --> 00:22:57.862
Come on, Rita.

00:22:57.863 --> 00:23:00.196
His name was Benjamin Richter.

00:23:00.197 --> 00:23:02.698
But everybody called him Mr. Jingles.

00:23:04.902 --> 00:23:07.537
Richter was drafted
into the Vietnam War.

00:23:07.538 --> 00:23:10.139
They sent him off to Saigon,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.640
and that's where he found his calling.

00:23:14.744 --> 00:23:17.412
He had the highest kill
rate in his company.

00:23:17.413 --> 00:23:20.549
And even after he was wounded,

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.585
he went back for a second tour.

00:23:22.586 --> 00:23:24.386
See, he liked to kill,

00:23:24.387 --> 00:23:26.087
and he was good at it.

00:23:26.957 --> 00:23:28.924
He had a nasty habit

00:23:28.925 --> 00:23:31.927
of collecting trophies from his enemies.

00:23:31.928 --> 00:23:33.929
Cut off their ears

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.031
and strung them into a necklace.

00:23:36.032 --> 00:23:38.200
- Jesus.
- Army found out about it

00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:40.202
and gave him a dishonorable discharge.

00:23:40.203 --> 00:23:41.837
Richter came home to nothing.

00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:43.873
Only job he was able to get...

00:23:43.874 --> 00:23:46.108
was right here in Camp Redwood.

00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:49.110
Nobody knows exactly why he snapped.

00:23:49.111 --> 00:23:51.713
But one random night,

00:23:51.714 --> 00:23:54.048
Mr. Jingles grabs a knife

00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:56.316
and slaughters an entire cabin.

00:23:57.216 --> 00:23:59.320
Ten victims in all.

00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:00.855
You're wrong.

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:04.125
If you're gonna tell
a story, tell it right.

00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:06.661
Alcohol is not allowed.

00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:09.363
- Wha... God!
- Neither are those funny-smelling cigarettes.

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:10.498
What are those, cloves?

00:24:10.499 --> 00:24:12.667
So nothing happened here?

00:24:12.668 --> 00:24:14.335
No, there was a massacre.

00:24:14.336 --> 00:24:16.437
But only nine died, not ten.

00:24:16.438 --> 00:24:19.007
So Mr. Jingles is real?

00:24:24.145 --> 00:24:26.647
Now, I don't usually show off,

00:24:26.648 --> 00:24:29.583
but since you all are
helping me start this camp,

00:24:29.584 --> 00:24:31.817
I think you deserve to know everything.

00:24:36.824 --> 00:24:38.725
I was asleep when I heard it.

00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:41.662
It was the sound

00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:44.497
of his keys... jingling.

00:24:44.498 --> 00:24:46.166
I opened my eyes

00:24:46.167 --> 00:24:48.334
a split-second before I felt the blade.

00:24:48.335 --> 00:24:49.836
But I knew

00:24:49.837 --> 00:24:52.338
I was going to die.

00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:54.808
_

00:24:54.809 --> 00:24:58.043
But then a miracle happened.

00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:03.950
I saw a bubble

00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:05.952
rising to the surface,

00:25:05.953 --> 00:25:08.520
and I had this powerful urge

00:25:08.521 --> 00:25:11.624
to follow it up to the light.

00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:13.893
I was so scared.

00:25:13.894 --> 00:25:16.629
I didn't know how I could stay still.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.399
But then the light became so bright.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.602
I was lost in it,

00:25:22.603 --> 00:25:26.572
in the warmth and peace.

00:25:26.573 --> 00:25:29.374
It was Jesus.

00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:31.577
I had known him my whole life,

00:25:31.578 --> 00:25:33.912
but I truly met him that day.

00:25:33.913 --> 00:25:36.526
I floated out of my body,

00:25:36.527 --> 00:25:39.624
held aloft by the wings of an angel.

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:42.153
From above, I saw him cut off

00:25:42.154 --> 00:25:44.889
my ear, but I gave him nothing.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.892
Not a twitch or a sound.

00:25:47.893 --> 00:25:50.895
And that's how I managed to survive,

00:25:50.896 --> 00:25:52.731
through the grace of God

00:25:52.732 --> 00:25:54.766
and His mercy.

00:26:01.306 --> 00:26:03.274
What happened to Mr. Jingles?

00:26:03.275 --> 00:26:04.976
He was arrested and put on trial.

00:26:04.977 --> 00:26:07.911
I was the star witness.

00:26:07.912 --> 00:26:10.948
The jury only took an
hour to find him guilty,

00:26:10.949 --> 00:26:13.650
and I thought, "That
will be the end of it."

00:26:15.787 --> 00:26:17.288
But I can't escape him.

00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:21.659
And that's why I bought this camp.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.661
To reopen it.

00:26:23.662 --> 00:26:26.664
And to take all of my darkest memories

00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:30.000
and turn them into
something bright and happy.

00:26:30.001 --> 00:26:32.502
Dude.

00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:34.437
That's heavy.

00:26:34.438 --> 00:26:36.640
Okay, well...

00:26:36.641 --> 00:26:38.876
the kids are coming tomorrow,

00:26:38.877 --> 00:26:40.810
and this is the last time

00:26:40.811 --> 00:26:44.313
I want anyone talking
about that horrible night.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.586
Oh, Jesus.

00:28:06.587 --> 00:28:09.589
You can't creep up on people like that.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.625
You...

00:28:11.626 --> 00:28:13.660
you shouldn't be here.

00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:15.094
I was worried about you.

00:28:17.165 --> 00:28:19.166
What are you doing out of bed?

00:28:19.167 --> 00:28:21.836
Come on, you should be resting.

00:28:23.872 --> 00:28:26.874
Man, you don't look so good.

00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:28.876
There's nobody I can call?

00:28:28.877 --> 00:28:31.879
F-Family, friends?

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.881
Phone lines are down.

00:28:33.882 --> 00:28:35.482
Seriously?

00:28:35.483 --> 00:28:38.219
It's a miracle they let
them reopen this dump.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.719
Reopen?

00:28:41.489 --> 00:28:43.056
Where are we?

00:28:43.057 --> 00:28:45.124
It's a summer camp. Camp Redwood?

00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:46.860
No.

00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:49.028
No, you have to leave.

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.997
Something terrible is gonna happen.

00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:52.365
No, I don't understand. What...

00:28:52.366 --> 00:28:54.367
Get out! Go, now!

00:28:55.636 --> 00:28:57.871
I think there's something
wrong with the hiker.

00:28:57.872 --> 00:29:01.174
When I went to check
on him, he wigged out.

00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:02.776
I think he has a concussion.

00:29:02.777 --> 00:29:05.211
I mean, we got him here, made sure

00:29:05.212 --> 00:29:06.212
he didn't die.

00:29:06.213 --> 00:29:08.147
Karmically, we're cool.

00:29:08.148 --> 00:29:09.483
He kept saying something bad

00:29:09.484 --> 00:29:11.818
is gonna happen.

Teach aerobics in Marina Del Rey.

Maybe you've taken one of my classes.

00:29:53.192 --> 00:29:54.359
They're pretty hot.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.694
Also, if you look closely

00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:58.696
at the end of the opening
credits of Three's Company

00:29:58.697 --> 00:30:01.699
when John Ritter and the girls
are on bikes on the boardwalk,

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.302
you can see me in the background.

00:30:03.303 --> 00:30:05.037
Shot it right at my condo.

00:30:05.038 --> 00:30:06.871
I love that show.

00:30:06.872 --> 00:30:09.541
I'm sorry, how does one go about
making a bet with themselves?

00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:12.877
No, no, no. Wait. You were in
the Jane Fonda workout video.

00:30:12.878 --> 00:30:14.046
Ah.

00:30:14.047 --> 00:30:15.780
Originally, yes.

00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:18.783
First row, right next
to Ms. Fonda herself.

00:30:20.086 --> 00:30:22.053
I call her Jane.

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:26.858
I've seen that video a bunch of times.

00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:28.159
You're not in it.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.428
Well, not in the one that
went out to the public.

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:33.130
We shot the original for two days.

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.899
But when they tested
it with an audience,

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.900
they realized I was
pulling focus from Jane.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.438
Well...

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:43.441
a certain part of me was.

00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:46.611
That thing was flopping around

00:30:46.612 --> 00:30:48.078
like a baby elephant's trunk.

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:50.414
They had to recast and reshoot.

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.416
You must have seen one
of those bootleg VHS tapes

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:53.751
that's been floating around.

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:55.820

You'd lift your legs to a
perfect 90 degrees and kick out.

just thinking about it.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.418
You don't want to be in the
water with that lightning rod.

00:32:35.419 --> 00:32:37.519
- Let's go.
- Okay.

Dr. Hopple.

00:33:24.066 --> 00:33:26.400
What in God's name is going on?

00:33:26.401 --> 00:33:28.336
It's a mess, Doctor.

00:33:28.337 --> 00:33:30.338

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:32.073
One of the patients?

00:33:32.074 --> 00:33:34.242
The entire hospital
is on the front lawn.

00:33:34.243 --> 00:33:36.911
He hit the master
release on the way out.

00:33:36.912 --> 00:33:39.147
Opened all the cell doors.

00:33:39.148 --> 00:33:40.581
Who?

00:33:40.582 --> 00:33:42.150
Mr. Jingles.

00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:44.085
I mean, Benjamin Richter.

00:33:44.086 --> 00:33:46.119
Please tell me he's not still loose.

00:33:47.156 --> 00:33:49.157
We have patrols combing the grounds.

00:33:49.158 --> 00:33:50.896
Local police are setting up roadblocks.

00:33:50.897 --> 00:33:52.321
He's not gonna get far.

00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:54.278
How did this happen?

_

00:34:03.938 --> 00:34:05.872
Richter, you dumb fuck.

00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:32.095
Saved the taxpayers a lot of money.

00:36:33.095 --> 00:36:35.119
_

00:36:47.642 --> 00:36:49.642
Aw, shit!

00:37:05.393 --> 00:37:06.727
Oh!

00:37:06.728 --> 00:37:08.327
Jesus!

00:37:08.328 --> 00:37:10.497

00:38:12.881 --> 00:38:16.049
What the fucking fuck?

00:38:27.629 --> 00:38:29.462
Yes.

00:38:29.463 --> 00:38:31.164
They're replaying it.

00:38:31.165 --> 00:38:33.199
Stop!

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.667
There.

00:38:34.668 --> 00:38:37.337
There it is.

00:38:37.338 --> 00:38:39.306
This sucks.

00:38:39.307 --> 00:38:42.275
Best athletes in the world
in one place, and I'm missing it.

00:38:42.276 --> 00:38:43.944
I should be in the Parade of Nations.

00:38:43.945 --> 00:38:45.511
I know exactly what you missing.

00:38:45.512 --> 00:38:47.180
The fuck fest.

00:38:47.181 --> 00:38:48.848
Athletes are skanks.

00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:50.817
There's a reason why they
hand out 20,000 condoms

00:38:50.818 --> 00:38:52.217
at the Olympics.

00:38:52.218 --> 00:38:53.819
Sounds like heaven to me.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.388
I heard the male athletes
outnumber the females

00:38:56.389 --> 00:38:58.390
five to one.

00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:00.059
That's some tough competition.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.661
- What the fuck would you know about it?
- Whoa.

00:39:02.662 --> 00:39:04.163
Dude,

00:39:04.164 --> 00:39:05.331
shut up already.

00:39:05.332 --> 00:39:06.498
She was just trying to help.

00:39:06.499 --> 00:39:08.200
You're being a dick.

00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:09.835
Fuck you.

00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:11.337
- Chet, what the hell?
- Okay!

00:39:11.338 --> 00:39:12.504
Shit!

00:39:12.505 --> 00:39:13.872
My bad. I-I didn't mean to do...

00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:15.341
Back off!

00:39:15.342 --> 00:39:17.442
Nurse, a little help?

00:39:17.443 --> 00:39:18.743
I clocked out already.

00:39:18.744 --> 00:39:19.811
I'm here for the kids.

00:39:19.812 --> 00:39:20.957
You want bandages,

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:22.014
you can find 'em yourself.

00:39:22.015 --> 00:39:24.147
Goddamn 'roid rage.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.627
Nice.

00:39:35.628 --> 00:39:37.628
That was real smooth.

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:49.451
_

00:40:15.133 --> 00:40:16.298
Fuck.

00:40:17.903 --> 00:40:19.970
You okay?

00:40:19.971 --> 00:40:21.839
I think Chet really is sorry.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.240
He's just drunk.

00:40:23.241 --> 00:40:24.640
No, he's just an asshole.

00:40:26.489 --> 00:40:28.322
Can I see?

00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:35.284
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

00:40:35.285 --> 00:40:37.619
- Oh. Sorry.
- It's all right.

00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:42.959
It's still bleeding.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.095
I'm gonna go look for
some bandages and...

00:40:46.096 --> 00:40:48.064
maybe some iodine.

00:40:48.065 --> 00:40:49.465
- You don't have to do that.
- Just...

00:40:49.466 --> 00:40:50.466
I don't mind.

00:40:50.467 --> 00:40:53.036
All right, just keep pressure.

00:40:53.037 --> 00:40:54.470
All right.

00:40:54.471 --> 00:40:56.438
Be safe.

00:41:41.049 --> 00:41:43.050
Aah!

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:53.788
Gina Hemphill,

00:41:53.789 --> 00:41:56.117
granddaughter of the great Jesse Owens,

00:41:56.118 --> 00:41:58.960
hero of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.

00:41:58.961 --> 00:42:01.295
But will she light the flame?

00:42:06.659 --> 00:42:08.350
Rafer Johnson.

00:42:08.351 --> 00:42:10.528
He will light the Olympic flame.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:18.134
The last 25 steps you see rising...

00:42:38.943 --> 00:42:40.276
He's here!

00:42:40.277 --> 00:42:41.711
He's after me!

00:42:41.712 --> 00:42:43.612
He's trying to kill me!

00:42:43.613 --> 00:42:45.215
Who? What are you talking about?

00:42:45.216 --> 00:42:47.383
Mr. Jingles!

00:42:47.384 --> 00:42:50.720
- This is a joke, right?
- I could make out his raincoat.

00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:53.088
His hood. I kept hearing his keys.

00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:55.289
It was him.

00:42:58.629 --> 00:43:00.629
No, no, no, no! He's right outside!

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.274
I don't see anything.
There's nobody out here.

00:43:12.275 --> 00:43:14.009
Are you sure it was really Mr. Jingles?

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.612
Hasn't he been locked
up since, like, the '70s?

00:43:16.613 --> 00:43:19.815
No... I know it was him.

00:43:19.816 --> 00:43:22.816
He murdered the hiker
and he cut off his ear.

00:43:42.938 --> 00:43:44.938
He's right behind that door.

00:43:46.776 --> 00:43:48.942
I'm not going back in there.

00:44:07.462 --> 00:44:09.195
Girl...

00:44:09.196 --> 00:44:10.463
you trippin'.

00:44:13.802 --> 00:44:15.001
Wha... I...

00:44:15.002 --> 00:44:16.336
I don't understand.

00:44:16.337 --> 00:44:19.372
He was... he was right here!

00:44:19.373 --> 00:44:22.175
Well, he's not there anymore.

00:44:22.176 --> 00:44:24.978
Must have wandered back
to wherever he came from.

00:44:24.979 --> 00:44:26.413
Not our problem.

00:44:26.414 --> 00:44:28.982
I think I might've found
your raincoat killer.

00:44:28.983 --> 00:44:31.051
No, no, no. No, no, no.

00:44:31.052 --> 00:44:32.986
I am not imagining all of this!

00:44:32.987 --> 00:44:34.754
Well, yeah, but...

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:36.323
you did indulge in the righteous bush.

00:44:36.324 --> 00:44:37.924
How many hits did you take?

00:44:37.925 --> 00:44:39.359
- Zero.
- Then you probably just got

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.893
the mother of all contact highs.

00:44:40.894 --> 00:44:42.195
We toked on a crossbreed

00:44:42.196 --> 00:44:44.496
of Northern Lights and Nevil's Haze.

00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:51.671
What in heaven's name

00:44:51.672 --> 00:44:53.339
is going on here?

00:44:56.543 --> 00:44:58.544
It's, um... it's-it's my fault.

00:44:58.545 --> 00:45:00.241
- I thought...
- No, we came to check on that guy

00:45:00.242 --> 00:45:02.548
- they picked up on the road.
- How is he?

00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:05.550
I guess he was well enough to leave.

00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:08.187
Okay, good. That's one less
person for us to look after.

00:45:08.188 --> 00:45:09.455
Now, let's go get some rest.

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:10.688
We have a big day tomorrow.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.900
What happened to you?

00:45:21.901 --> 00:45:24.100
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

00:45:24.101 --> 00:45:25.437
Go clean yourself up.

00:45:59.405 --> 00:46:01.439
Montana, wake up.

00:46:02.742 --> 00:46:04.743
W... It's-it's me. It's Brooke.

00:46:04.744 --> 00:46:06.310
Why are you sleeping with a knife?

00:46:06.311 --> 00:46:07.812
I have a suspicious nature.

00:46:07.813 --> 00:46:09.313
Why are you waking me up?

00:46:09.314 --> 00:46:11.149
Someone's calling the pay phone.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.483
Who gives a shit?

00:46:12.484 --> 00:46:14.151
He said the phone lines were down.

00:46:14.152 --> 00:46:16.153
Whatever, Brooke.

00:46:57.528 --> 00:46:59.062
Hello?

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.033
Who is this?

00:47:10.374 --> 00:47:12.341
Satan, Satan, Satan.
