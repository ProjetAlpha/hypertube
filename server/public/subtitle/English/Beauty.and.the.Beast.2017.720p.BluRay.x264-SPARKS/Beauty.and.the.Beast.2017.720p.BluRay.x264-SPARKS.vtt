00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.956
Once upon a time,
in the hidden heart of France...

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.954
a handsome young prince...

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.954
lived in a beautiful castle.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.756
Poof! Poof!

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.320
Although he had
everything his heart desired...

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.473
the prince was selfish and unkind.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.313
Master, it's time.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.635
He taxed the village...

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.798
to fill his castle with
the most beautiful objects.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.680
And his parties with
the most beautiful people.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.351
Oh, how divine

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.478
Glamour, music and magic combine

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.871
See the maidens so anxious to shine

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.513
Look for a sign that enhances chances

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.474
She'll be his special one

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.639
What a display

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.310
What a breathtaking, thrilling array

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.314
Ev'ry prince
Ev'ry dog has his day

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.639
Let us sing with passion,
gusto, fit to bust, oh

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.116
Not a care in the world

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.840
Then one night...

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.152
an unexpected intruder arrived
at the castle...

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.671
seeking shelter from the bitter storm.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.396
As a gift, she offered
the prince, a single rose.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.592
Repulsed by her haggard appearance...

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.510
the prince turned the woman away.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.790
Hmm.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.709
But she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.112
For beauty is found within.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.952
When he dismissed her again...

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.595
the old woman's outward
appearance melted away.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.630
To reveal...

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.633
a beautiful enchantress.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.951
The prince begged for forgiveness,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.599
but it was too late.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.632
For she had seen that
there was no love in his heart.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.599
Chip! Chip! Oh, my!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.076
As punishment...

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.360
she transformed him into a hideous beast.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.439
And placed a powerful spell
on the castle...

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.079
and all who lived there.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.277
As days bled into years...

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.797
the prince and his servants
were forgotten by the world.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.640
For the enchantress had erased
all memory of them...

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.038
from the minds of the people they loved.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.831
But the rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.117
If he could learn to love another...

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.990
and earn their love in return
by the time the last petal fell...

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.800
the spell would be broken.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.672
If not, he would be doomed to
remain a beast for all time.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.349
As the years passed...

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.479
he fell into despair and lost all hope.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.634
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.393
Little town
It's a quiet village

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.230
Ev'ry day like the one before

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.074
Little town
Full of little people

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.476
Waking up to say

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.072
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.190
Bonjour!

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.115
There goes the baker
with his tray like always

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.199
The same old bread and rolls to sell

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.233
Every morning just the same

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.113
Since the morning that we came

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.714
To this poor provincial town

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.394
Good morning, Belle!

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.230
Good morning, Monsieur Jean!
Have you lost something again?

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.555
Well, I believe I have.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.393
The problem is, I can't remember what!

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.874
Oh, well. I'm sure it will come to me.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.356
Where are you off to?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.872
To return this book to Père Robert.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.997
It's about two lovers in fair Verona.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.270
Sounds boring.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.080
Look there she goes
That girl is strange, no question

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.277
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.399
Never part of any crowd

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.073
'Cause her head's up on some cloud

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.870
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.230
Bonjour, good day, how is your family?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.512
Bonjour, good day, how is your wife?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.639
I need six eggs
That's too expensive

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.272
There must be more
than this provincial life

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.800
Ah, if it isn't the only bookworm in town.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.759
So, where did you run off to this week?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.434
Two cities in Northern Italy.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.119
I didn't want to come back!

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.118
Have you got any new places to go?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.230
I'm afraid not.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.391
But you may reread any of
the old ones that you'd like.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.471
Thank you.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.840
Your library makes
our small corner of the world feel big.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.189
Bye.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.430
Look, there she goes
The girl is so peculiar

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.955
I wonder if she's feeling well

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.470
With a dreamy far off look
And her nose stuck in a book

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.236
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.831
Oh! Isn't this amazing

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.071
It's my favorite part because you'll see

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.678
Here's where she meets Prince Charming

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.759
But she won't discover that it's him

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.513
'Til chapter three

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.437
Now it's no wonder
That her name means "beauty"

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.072
Her looks have got no parallel

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.830
But behind that fair façade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.798
Very different from the rest of us

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.872
She's nothing like the rest of us

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.271
Yes, different from the rest of us

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.033
Is Belle

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.195
Look at her, LeFou.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.111
My future wife.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.715
Belle is the most
beautiful girl in the village.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.433
That makes her the best.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.552
But she's so well-read.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.478
And you're so...

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.200
- athletically inclined.
- I know.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.110
Belle can be as argumentative
as she is beautiful.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.874
Exactly! Who needs her when you've got us!

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.440
Yes...

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.920
But ever since the war,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.037
I've felt like
I've been missing something.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.835
And she's the only girl
that gives me that sense of...

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.919
I don't know what that means.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.560
Right from the moment

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.075
When I met her, saw her

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.955
I said she's gorgeous and I fell

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.199
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.990
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.673
Look there he goes

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.993
Isn't he dreamy

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.517
Monsieur Gaston, oh, he's so cute

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.233
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.037
He's such a tall, dark
Strong and handsome brute

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.595
It's never gonna happen, ladies.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.230
- Bonjour
- Pardon

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.356
- Good day
- Mais, oui

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.113
- You call this bacon
- What lovely flowers

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.270
- Some cheese
- Ten yards

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.430
- One pound
- 'Scuse me

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.159
- I'll get the knife
- Please let me through

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.191
- This bread
- Those fish

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.270
- It's stale
- They smell

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.669
- Madame's mistaken
- Well, maybe so

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.678
There must be more
than this provincial life

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.353
Good morning

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.511
Just watch I'm going to make Belle my wife

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.478
Oh! Good morning

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.230
Look there she goes
A girl who's strange but special

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.632
A most peculiar mademoiselle

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.515
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.230
But she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.316
She really is a funny girl

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.316
That Belle

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.994
Good morning, Belle!

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.073
Wonderful book you have there.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.994
Have you read it?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.315
Well, not that one.
But, you know, books...

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.272
For your dinner table.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.794
Shall I join you this evening?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.516
Sorry, not this evening.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.080
Busy?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.670
No...

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.512
So, moving on?

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.000
No, LeFou.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.113
It's the ones who play hard to get

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.953
that are always the sweetest prey.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.799
That's what makes Belle so appealing.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.229
She hasn't made a fool of herself

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.198
just to gain my favor.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.874
What would you call that?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.400
Dignity?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.398
It's outrageously attractive, isn't it?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.476
Gaston!

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.789
Mmm.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.070
Mmm.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.840
How does a moment last forever

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.874
How can a story never die

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.758
It is love we must hold on to

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.956
Never easy but we try

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.231
Sometimes our happiness is captured

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.600
Somehow a time and place stand still

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.915
Love lives on inside our hearts

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.719
And always will

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.910
Oh.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.234
Belle.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.550
Hmm.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.434
Could you...

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.510
Hand me a...

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.999
Thank you.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.116
And I also need...

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.431
No. No. No.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.630
Actually...

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.275
yes, that's exactly
what I need. Thank you.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.757
- Papa, do you think I'm odd?
- Odd?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.118
My daughter? Odd?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.953
Where did you get an idea like that?

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.113
I don't know. People talk.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.396
This is a small village, you know.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.631
Small minded as well.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.597
But small also means safe.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.834
Even back in Paris,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.151
I knew a girl like you, who was so...

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.632
ahead of her time.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.678
So different.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.429
People mocked her.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.877
Until the day they all found
themselves imitating her.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.640
Please, just tell me
one more thing about her.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.037
Your mother was...

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.116
fearless.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.200
Fearless.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.717
So...

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.591
what can I bring you from the market?

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.395
A rose. Like the one in the painting.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.398
You ask for that every year!

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.233
And every year you bring it.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.549
Then I shall bring you another.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.198
You have my word.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.840
- Goodbye, Papa.
- Goodbye, Belle.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.232
Come on, Philippe.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.590
You know the way.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.910
I'll see you tomorrow!

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.397
Right. Tomorrow, with the rose.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.353
Stay safe.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.233
What are you doing?

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.270
The laundry.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.360
Come! Come!

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.318
"The blue bird..."

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.676
"That flies...

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.109
"over the dark...

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.520
"wood."

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.790
That was amazing!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.151
What on earth are you doing?

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.676
Teaching another girl to read?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.837
Isn't one enough?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.639
We have to do something.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.717
You are the wildest...

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.639
most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.520
Nobody deserves you.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.354
But at least I know
our children will be beautiful.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.796
Am I catching you at a bad time?

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.634
- What is it, LeFou?
- A certain damsel is in distress.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.918
Ah. It's hero time.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.598
I'm not done with you yet.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.316
Me, neither.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.717
Belle! I heard you had trouble
with the Headmaster.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.360
He never liked me either.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.477
Can I give you a little advice
about the villagers though?

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.712
They're never going to trust
the kind of change you're trying to bring.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.360
All I wanted was to teach a child to read.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.950
The only children you should
concern yourself with...

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.836
are your own.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.395
I'm...

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.477
not ready to have children.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.233
Maybe you haven't met the right man.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.472
It's a small village, Gaston.
I've met them all.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.915
Well, maybe you should take another look.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.793
Some of us have changed.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.871
Gaston...

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.117
we could never make each other happy.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.359
No one can change that much.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.556
Oh, Belle.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.957
Do you know what happens
to spinsters in this village

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.230
after their fathers die?

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.232
Coins? Got any spare coins?

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.393
They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.075
This is our world, Belle.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.315
For simple folk like us,
it doesn't get any better.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.159
I might be a farm girl.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.755
But, I'm not simple...

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.834
and I'm never going to marry you, Gaston.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.956
I'm sorry!

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.953
Can you imagine?

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.999
Me? The wife of that boorish...

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.110
brainless...

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.476
Madame Gaston, can't you just see it

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.240
Madame Gaston, his little wife

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.356
Ugh!

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.678
No, sir, not me, I guarantee it

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.834
I want much more than this provincial life

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.155
I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.994
I want it more than I can tell

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.074
And for once it might be grand

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.080
To have someone understand

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:50.197
I want so much more
Than they've got planned

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.351
The woods are lovely.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.353
I only wish I recognized them.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.712
Do you know where we are,
Philippe? Because I don't.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.714
It's all right. It's all right, Philippe.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.520
Hmm.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.311
Yes, we can go this way.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.153
Go on. To the right.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.951
That's it. Steady!

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.554
Walk on!

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.155
One path closes...

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.560
another one opens.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.749
It's all right, boy.
It's just a bit of snow.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.439
In June.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.710
Mind your step.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.880
It's slippery.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.109
Go! Go, Philippe! Come on! Come on!

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.317
Whoa.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.634
Come on!

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.119
Go! Philippe, go! Go, go!

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.394
Whoa!

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.234
Philippe!

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.074
Good boy.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.272
Go, boy. Go!

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.557
Oh, Philippe, you saved my life.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.279
Well done. Yes.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.360
They'll have to get
their dinner somewhere else,

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.675
won't they?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.269
Look!

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.590
There's hay.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.316
And water.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.995
You're all set, my old friend.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.279
I'll go pay my respects
to our unwitting host.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.151
Whoever that may be.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.150
Hmm.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.995
Thank you.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.995
Thank...

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.870
Hello?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.880
Hello?

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.633
Sorry to intrude.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.837
I'm just a traveler...

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.909
seeking shelter from the storm.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.392
Sorry to disturb you.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.474
Anyone home?

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.960
Anyone awake?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.553
He must have lost his way in the woods.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.632
Shut up, you idiot!

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.919
Excuse me?

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.793
Hmm.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.718
Beautiful.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.919
Extraordinary.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.710
A man of taste.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.439
He was talking about me.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.156
Oops!

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.273
Well, wherever you are...

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.916
I'm just going to warm myself by the fire.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.720
That's better.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.513
Oh, much better.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.790
Ooh.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.360
Thank you.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.072
Mum said I wasn't supposed to move
because it might be scary.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.990
Sorry.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.073
It's all right.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.350
I, uh...

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.077
I cannot...

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.356
thank you enough for your hospitality.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.394
I'll...

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.039
bid you adieu...

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.757
and good night.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.515
Come on, Philippe! Go! Go!

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.238
No, wait, wait, wait!

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.192
Roses. I nearly forgot.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.719
We're safe here.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.512
I promised Belle a rose.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.591
There!

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.791
Philippe!

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.270
What happened?

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.034
Where's Papa?

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.470
Take me to him!

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.992
Look, Cogsworth.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.520
A beautiful girl!

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.036
Yes! I can see it's a girl.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.199
I lost my hands, not my eyes.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.839
But what if she is the one?

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.633
The one who'll break the spell?

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.590
Who said that?

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.871
Who's there?

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.070
Uh-oh.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.995
Papa?

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.634
Papa, is that you?

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.876
Belle!

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.599
How did you find me?

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.599
Your hands are ice.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.915
We need to get you home.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.077
Belle, you must leave here at once!

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.795
This castle is alive!

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.513
Now go, before he finds you!

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.670
Who?

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.439
Who's there?

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.600
Who are you?

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.558
Who are you?

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.831
I've come for my father.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.433
Your father is a thief.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.034
Liar!

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.349
He stole a rose.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.153
I asked for the rose.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.760
Punish me, not him.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.872
No! He means forever.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.039
Apparently, that's what
happens around here

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.316
when you pick a flower.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.156
A life sentence for a rose?

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.360
I received eternal damnation for one.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.756
I'm merely locking him away.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.518
Now, do you still wish
to take your father's place?

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.994
Come into the light.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.950
Choose.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.390
Belle, I won't let you do this.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.073
I lost your mother.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.470
I won't lose you, too.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.074
Now, go.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.879
Go!

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.271
All right, Papa. I'll leave.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.079
I need a minute alone with him.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.916
Are you so cold-hearted...

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.834
you won't allow a daughter
to kiss her father goodbye?

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.351
Forever can spare a minute.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.591
When this door closes,
it will not open again.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.759
I should have been with you.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.951
Oh, no, no. Belle, listen to me.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.959
It's all right.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.554
Now go.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.400
Live your life.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.880
And forget me.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.440
Forget you?

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.438
Everything I am is because of you.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.153
I love you, Belle.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.549
Don't be afraid.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.192
I love you too, Papa.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.559
I'm not afraid.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.959
And I will escape. I promise.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.390
What?

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.875
You took his place.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.553
He's my father.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.120
He's a fool.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.398
And so are you.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.710
Belle...

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.036
Papa!

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.918
Don't hurt him!

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.229
- Papa!
- No!

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.590
I'll come back!

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.589
I promise!

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.991
Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle...

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.153
but I have come to escort you
to your room.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.993
My room?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.234
- But I thought...
- Oh, what?

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.075
That "Once this door closes
it will not open again"?

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.117
I know.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.310
He gets so dramatic.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.119
Hello.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.710
Ooh!

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.880
Oh, you are very strong.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.679
This is a great quality.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.396
What are you?

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.155
I am Lumière!

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.670
And you can talk?

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.991
Well, of course he can talk.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.159
It's all he ever does.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.355
Now, Lumière, as head of the household...

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.153
I demand that you put her
back in her cell at once.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.471
What do you want to be
for the rest of your life, Cogsworth?

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.319
A man, or a mantle clock?

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.276
Ready, miss?

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.592
- Trust me.
- Oh...

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.835
You must forgive first impressions.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.150
I hope you are not too startled.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.152
Why would I be startled?

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.191
I'm talking to a candle.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.993
Candelabra, please.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.435
Enormous difference.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.910
But consider me at your service.
The castle is your home now...

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.958
so feel free to go anywhere you like.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.000
Except the west wing.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.353
Which we do not have.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.949
Why? What's in the west wing?

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.110
- Oh, nothing.
- Nothing.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.475
- Storage space.
- Storage space.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.756
- That's it.
- That's it.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.870
Yes, that's it.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.400
This way, please. To the east wing.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.395
Or as I like to call it, the only wing.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.631
Watch your step, s'il vous plaît!

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.591
Welcome to your new home.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.518
It's modest, but comfortable.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.638
It's beautiful.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.120
But of course!

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.709
Master wanted you to have
the finest room in the castle.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.555
Oh, dear. We were not expecting guests.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.471
Enchantée, mademoiselle.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.275
Don't worry.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.154
I'll have this place spotless in no time.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.591
This plan of yours is dangerous.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.798
I would risk anything
to kiss you again, Plumette.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.515
No, my love. I've been
burned by you before.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.511
We must be strong.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.036
How can I be strong
when you make me so weak?

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.674
Is everything here alive?

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.237
Hello. What's your name?

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.192
That is a hairbrush.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.113
Do not be alarmed.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.356
This is just your wardrobe.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.070
Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.753
When she can stay awake.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.551
Cogsworth! A diva needs her beauty rest.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.711
Stay with us, Madame.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.314
We have someone for you to dress!

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.636
Finally...

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.792
a woman.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.951
Pretty eyes.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:00.951
Proud face.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.958
Perfect canvas. Yes!

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.477
I will find you something
worthy of a princess.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.676
Oh, I'm not a princess.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.990
Nonsense!

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.794
Now, let's see
what I've got in my drawers.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.515
Oh!

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.000
How embarrassing.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.038
Froufrou, come help Mama.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.471
Subtle. Understated. I love it!

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.998
Froufrou, send my love to the maestro.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.033
Picture it, LeFou.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.594
A rustic cabin...

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.360
my latest kill roasting on the fire...

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.399
adorable children running
around us as my love...

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.679
rubs my tired feet.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.592
But what does Belle say?

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.229
"I will never marry you, Gaston!"

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.790
You know, there are other girls.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.676
A great hunter doesn't
waste his time on rabbits.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.918
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.072
Looking so down in the dumps

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.393
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.519
Even when taking your lumps

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.553
There's no man in town as admired as you

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.633
You're everyone's favorite guy

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.990
Everyone's awed and inspired by you

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.758
And it's not very hard to see why

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.800
No one's slick as Gaston

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.593
No one's quick as Gaston

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.191
No one's neck's as
incredibly thick as Gaston

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.671
For there's no man in town half as manly

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.117
Perfect, a pure paragon

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.119
You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.275
And they'll tell you
whose team they prefer to be on

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.356
Who plays

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.550
Darts like Gaston?

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.473
- Who breaks
- Hearts like Gaston?

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.439
Who's much more than the sum
of his parts like Gaston?

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.759
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.958
My, what a guy, that Gaston

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.474
I needed encouragement

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.954
Thank you, LeFou

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.359
Well, there's no one
As easy to bolster as you

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.390
Too much?

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.755
Yep!

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.159
No one fights like Gaston

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.913
Douses lights like Gaston

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.835
In a wrestling match
Nobody bites like Gaston

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.520
When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.591
And beasts of the field say a prayer

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.470
Aah...

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.516
First I carefully aim for the liver

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.556
Then I shoot from behind

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.790
Is that fair?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.280
I don't care

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.033
No one hits like Gaston

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.480
Matches wits like Gaston

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.440
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.070
I'm especially good at expectorating

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.998
Ooh!

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.678
Ten points for Gaston!

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.519
Thank you. Thank you.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.318
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.120
Every morning to help me get large

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.032
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.194
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.679
Hey! Hey!

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.031
Hey!

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.270
Hey!

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.871
Hey!

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.872
Hey! Hey!

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.117
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.114
Who has brains

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.190
Like Gaston

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.794
- Entertains
- Like Gaston

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.989
Who can make up
these endless refrains like Gaston

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:19.720
I use antlers in all of my decorating

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.632
Say it again

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.432
Who's a man among men?

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.433
Who's a super success?

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.954
Don't you know? Can't you guess?

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.113
Ask his fans and his five hangers-on

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.351
There's just one guy in town
Who's got all of it down

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:45.318
And his name's, G-A-S-T

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.915
I believe there's another 'T'

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.039
It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.513
And I've never actually had
to spell it out loud before

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.918
Gaston

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.155
Oh, LeFou, you're the best.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.516
How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.031
I've been told I'm clingy,
but I really don't get it.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.120
Please, please. Someone, someone.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.480
- You, help...
- Whoa, whoa.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.710
You must help me.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.473
It's Belle! He's got, he's got Belle.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.789
She's locked in a dungeon.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.200
Who's got her?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.151
A beast!

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.069
A huge, horrid, monstrous beast!

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.553
My daughter's life is in danger.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.916
Why do you laugh? It's not a joke.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.875
His castle is hidden in the woods.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.957
It's already winter there.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.872
Winter in June?

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.679
Crazy old Maurice!

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.717
Listen to me!

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.439
The beast is real.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.792
Do you understand?

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.236
Will no one help me?

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.516
I'll help, Maurice.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.591
What?

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.194
You will?

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.589
Everybody...

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.916
stop making fun of this man at once.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.713
Captain, thank you.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.792
Don't thank me, Maurice.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.713
Lead us to the beast.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.474
Come.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.750
Hmm.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.750
Oh.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.193
Mama! There's a girl in the castle!

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.913
Yes, Chip, we know!

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.030
What kind of tea does she like?

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.918
Herbal, oolong...

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.275
chamomile...

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.396
I'm too excited!

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.280
Slow down before you break your handle.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.760
- Heads up, Mrs. Potts.
- Oh.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.278
Lumière!

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.078
- Oh!
- Be calm. Let me do the talking.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.474
You're making her dinner!

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.472
Well, we thought you might
appreciate the company.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.836
Master, I just want to assure you...

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.792
that I had no part in this hopeless plan.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.954
Preparing a dinner, designing
a gown for her, giving her...

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.480
a suite in the east wing!

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.359
You gave her a bedroom?

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.960
No, no, no. He gave her a bedroom.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.276
This is true.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.158
But if this girl is the one
who can break the spell...

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.040
then maybe you could start
by using dinner to charm her.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.351
- Good thinking, Cogsworth.
- What?

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.630
That's the most ridiculous idea...

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.837
I've ever heard. Charm the prisoner!

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.674
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.792
we become less human.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.196
She's the daughter of a common thief.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.874
What kind of person do you
think that makes her?

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.832
Oh, you can't judge people...

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.151
by who their father is, now can you?

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.199
You'll join me for dinner.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.680
That's not a request.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.160
Gently, Master.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.794
The girl lost her father...

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.678
and her freedom in one day.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.514
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there,
scared to death.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.830
Exactly.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.193
Just a minute.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.757
You see? There she is.
Now, remember, be gentle.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.832
- Kind!
- Charming!

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.717
Sweet!

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.079
And when she opens the door,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.520
Come, come. Show me the smile.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.190
- Oh, mon dieu!
- Oh, no.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.030
Will you join me for dinner?

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.353
You've taken me as your prisoner

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.716
and now you want to have dinner with me?

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.555
Are you insane?

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.397
Uh-oh. He's losing it.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.920
Oh, dear!

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.791
I told you to join me for dinner.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.400
And I told you no.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.115
Ooh! What time is it?

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.356
What's happening?

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.513
I'd starve before I ever ate with you.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.869
Well, be my guest.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.713
Go ahead and starve.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.200
If she doesn't eat with me...

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.714
then she doesn't eat at all.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.710
Idiots!

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.675
You can't talk to us
like that. I forbid it.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.754
Uh... Oh. Am I too late?

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.435
Shame, I was really going to
tell him off this time.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.671
Oh, Master, you've returned.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.672
- Oh, very funny.
- I got you there.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.913
Show me the girl.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.675
Another petal fell.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.637
Lumière...

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.831
I grew three more feathers.
And I just plucked yesterday.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.997
I know, darling.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.514
I'm getting more metallic every day.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.753
Oh, no. It's happening again. Pardon me.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.912
Oh, everyone, calm yourselves.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.073
- We still have time.
- Mama...

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.590
am I ever going to be a boy again?

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.240
Oh, yes, Chip. You'll have your days...

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.159
in the sun again. You just leave it to me.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.873
I told you to go away.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.799
Don't worry, dear. It's only Mrs. Potts.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.710
Oh!

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.474
Oh, aren't you a vision!

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.630
How lovely...

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.996
to make your acquaintance.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.237
It's a very long journey.
Let me fix you up...

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.674
before you go.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.956
I have found...

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.515
that most troubles seem less troubling...

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.672
after a bracing cup of tea.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.280
Slowly now, Chip.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.230
Pleased to meet you.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.680
Wanna see me do a trick?

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.112
Chip!

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.154
That was a very brave thing
you did for your father, dearie.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.919
Yes.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.559
We all think so.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.915
I'm worried about him.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.035
He's never been on his own.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.913
Cheer up, my poppet.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.430
Things will turn out in the end.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.840
You'll feel a lot better...

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.354
after dinner.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.239
But he said, "If she doesn't eat with me,

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.720
then she doesn't eat at all."

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.629
Mmm, people say a lot of things in anger.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.717
It is our choice whether or not to listen.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.350
You coming, poppet?

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:31.916
Go!

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.359
They are coming. Final checks,
everyone! Tout de suite!

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.431
No, you don't!

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.472
If the master finds out
you violated his orders

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.080
and fed her he will blame me!

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.560
Yes, I will make sure of it.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.359
But did you see her stand up to him?

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.233
I am telling you, this girl is the one.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.432
They must fall in love
if we are to be human again...

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.637
and how can they fall in love
if she stays in her room?

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.473
Hey, Chapeau, you missed a spot.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.120
You know she'll never love him.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.233
A broken clock is right
two times a day, mon ami...

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.959
but this is not one of those times.
Stand up straight!

00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.753
It's time to sparkle!

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.639
Mmm! I have no taste buds,

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.234
but I can tell this is exquisite.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.153
Off! Off me while I work!

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.391
Pepper, get cracking! Salt, shake a leg!

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.473
Not so loud! Keep it down.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.791
Of course, of course!
But what is dinner...

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.473
without a little music?

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.670
Music?

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.480
Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.916
It has been so long
since I have performed.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.515
I can barely even remember how.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.839
- Ah!
- Ooh!

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.509
Another cavity.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.438
Maestro, your wife is upstairs...

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.990
finding it harder and harder
to stay awake.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.079
She's counting on you
to help us break this curse.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.193
Then I shall play through the dental pain.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.835
Maestro, play quietly, please.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.876
Oh, quietly. Sotto voce! Of course!

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.316
Are there any other tasteless demands...

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.595
you wish to make upon my artistry?

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.476
No, that's it.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.552
There you are, dear.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.472
Ma chère mademoiselle.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.231
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure...

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.198
that we welcome you tonight.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.596
Here! And now...

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.837
we invite you to relax.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.594
Let us pull up a chair...

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.236
as the dining room proudly presents...

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.277
Your dinner!

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.749
Be our guest, be our guest

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.674
Put our service to the test

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.594
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chérie

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.712
And we'll provide the rest

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.679
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.672
Why we only live to serve

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.195
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.840
Don't believe me? Ask the dishes

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.594
They can sing, they can dance

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.956
After all, miss, this is France

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.955
And a dinner here is never second best

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.835
Go on unfold your menu

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.474
Take a glance and then you'll

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.712
Be our guest, oui, our guest

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.473
Be our guest

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.630
Ooh!

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.070
Beef ragout

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.514
Cheese soufflé

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.154
Pie and pudding en flambé

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.109
We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.475
You're alone and you're scared

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.631
But the banquet's all prepared

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.513
No one's gloomy or complaining

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.592
While the flatware's entertaining

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.353
We tell jokes, I do tricks

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.120
With my fellow candlesticks

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.791
And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.991
Come on and lift your glass

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.231
You've won your own free pass

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.993
To be our guest

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.959
If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.030
Be our guest

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.996
Be our guest, be our guest

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.474
Life is so unnerving

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.950
For a servant who's not serving

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:21.114
He's not whole
Without a soul to wait upon

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.073
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.111
Eh, Cogsworth?

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:31.433
Suddenly those good old days are gone

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.398
Too long we've been rusting

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.359
Needing so much more than dusting

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.877
Needing exercise,
a chance to use our skills

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.158
Most days we just lay around the castle

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.800
Flabby, fat and lazy

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.076
You walked in and whoops-a-daisy

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.953
It's a guest, it's a guest

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.997
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.958
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.111
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.357
With dessert, she'll want tea

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.318
And my dear, that's fine with me

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.358
While the cups do their soft-shoeing

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.995
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.472
I'll get warm, piping hot

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.233
Heaven's sakes, is that a spot?

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.155
Clean it up, we want the company impressed

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.152
We've got a lot to do

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.351
Is it one lump or two?

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.874
For you, our guest

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.317
She's our guest

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.193
Be our guest, be our guest

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.118
Our command is your request

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.994
It's been years since we've had anybody

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.400
Here and we're obsessed

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.517
With your meal

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.757
With your ease

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.960
Yes indeed, we aim to please

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.794
While the candlelight's still glowing

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.276
Let us help you, we'll keep going

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.878
Course by

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.590
Course! One by one

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.434
'Til you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.557
Then we'll sing you off to sleep

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.233
As you digest

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.798
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now let's eat up

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.754
Be our guest

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.233
Be our guest

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:37.476
Please be our guest

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.472
Pudding?

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.870
I don't understand why
you're all being so kind to me.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.716
Surely, you're as trapped here as I am.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.399
Don't you ever want to escape?

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:57.470
The master's not
as terrible as he appears.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.236
Somewhere deep in his soul,
there's a prince...

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:05.479
of a fellow who just waiting
to be set free.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.195
Lumière mentioned something
about the west wing.

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.829
Never you mind about that.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.996
Off to bed with you, poppet.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.476
- Good night.
- Nighty-night.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.033
Straight to bed.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.192
What are you doing here?
What did you do to it?

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.191
Nothing.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.430
Do you realize what you could have done?

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.954
You could have damned us all!

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.235
Get out of here!

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.440
Go!

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.472
Checkmate. Again.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.472
Wait! No! You cheated again.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.320
Mademoiselle, what are you doing?

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.153
Getting out of here.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.515
Stop!

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.755
Go! Go! Froufrou!

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.920
Yes, Froufrou. Stop her.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.480
Don't let her leave!

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.239
Stop her!

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.310
No! No! Froufrou!

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.669
No! No, it's not play time!

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.752
Not now, silly boy.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.274
Bad dog. Bad dog!

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.993
No! No! No!

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.389
Please don't go!

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.636
It's dangerous!

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.473
Oh, my!

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.316
You have to help me.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.558
You have to stand.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.150
No! I'm sure this is the way.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.549
Do you hear those wolves?

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.679
That means we're getting
very close to the castle.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.520
Look, enough is enough.
We have to turn back.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.557
Stop!

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.876
That's it! There it is!

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.199
That's the tree!

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.470
I'm sure of it.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.190
It was downed by lightning at the time.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.113
But now...

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.112
it's resumed an upright position...

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.429
through some sort of...

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.351
magic or other.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.631
You really wanna marry into this family?

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.790
So, that means...

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.710
that the castle is that...

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.790
No.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.630
No, it's...

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.117
That way.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.039
Definitely, that way.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.438
I am done playing this game of yours.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.193
Where is Belle?

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.277
The beast took her and she...

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.557
There are no such things as beasts.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.472
Or talking teacups.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.869
Or magic!

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.431
But there are wolves,
frostbite, and starvation.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.318
Deep breaths, Gaston.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.557
Deep breaths.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.358
So, why don't we just turn around?
Go back to Villeneuve.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.995
I'm sure Belle is at home,
cooking up a lovely dinner.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.594
If you think I've made all this up...

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.633
then why did you offer to help?

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.433
Because I want to marry your daughter!

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.436
Now, let's go home.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.358
Belle is not at home.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.840
She is with the...

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.799
You say beast one more time...

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.752
I will feed you to the wolves!

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.275
Gaston! Stop it! Breathe!

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.517
Think happy thoughts. Go back to the war.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.074
Blood.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.675
Explosions. Countless widows.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.120
- Widows.
- Yes. Yes.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.560
That's it.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.433
That's it.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.234
Maurice!

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.750
Please, forgive me, old bean.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.156
That's no way to talk
to my future father-in-law...

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.236
now is it?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.396
Future father-in-law?

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.510
Yeah!

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.714
You will never marry my daughter.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.080
I saw that coming.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.070
If Maurice won't give me his blessing...

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.032
then he is in my way.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.600
Once the wolves are finished with him...

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.434
Belle will have no one
to take care of her but me.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.398
For the sake of exhausting
all of our options...

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.029
do we maybe wanna consider
a slightly less...

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.799
gruesome alternative?

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.836
Are you coming?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.870
Yah!

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.796
That hurts!

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.799
If you held still,
it wouldn't hurt as much.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.151
Well, if you hadn't run away,
none of this would have happened.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.436
Well, if you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.313
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.200
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.029
Try to get some rest.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.349
Thank you, miss.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.040
We are eternally grateful.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.635
Why do you care about him so much?

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.200
We've looked after him all his life.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.794
But he's cursed you somehow. Why?

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.030
You did nothing!

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.435
You're quite right there, dear.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.638
You see, when the master
lost his mother...

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.832
and his cruel father
took that sweet, innocent lad...

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.070
and twisted him up to be just like him...

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.637
we did nothing.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.154
Let him sleep.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.596
Days in the sun

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.754
When my life has barely begun

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.960
Not until my whole life is done

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.114
Will I ever leave you

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.037
Will I tremble again

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.240
To my dear one's gorgeous refrain

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.314
Will you now forever remain

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:27.436
Out of reach of my arms

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.638
Oh, those days in the sun

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.840
What I'd give to relive just one

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.354
'Night, Mama.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.876
Undo what's done

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.676
And bring back the light

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.356
Oh, I could sing

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.549
Of the pain these dark days bring

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:57.630
The spell we're under

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.955
Still it's the wonder of us
I sing of tonight

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.909
How in the midst of all this sorrow

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.596
Can so much hope and love endure

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.640
I was innocent and certain

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.510
Now I'm wiser but unsure

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.273
Days in the past

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.556
I can't go back into my childhood

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.110
Oh, those precious days couldn't last

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.715
One that my father made secure

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.991
I can feel a change in me

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.994
Oh, hold me closer

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.720
I'm stronger now but still not free

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.520
Days in the sun

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.840
Will return we must believe

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.552
As lovers do

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.519
That days in the sun

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:59.711
Will come shining through

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.396
What happens when the last petal falls?

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.358
The master remains a beast forever.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.193
And we become...

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.953
- Antiques.
- Knick-knacks.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.634
Lightly-used houseware.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.717
Rubbish.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.917
We become rubbish.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.512
I want to help you.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.791
There must be some way to break the curse.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.790
Well, there is one.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.912
It's not for you to worry about, lamb.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.596
We've made our bed and we must lie in it.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.029
Drink.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.439
Thank you, Agathe.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.829
"Love can transpose to form and dignity.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.151
"Love looks not with the eyes

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.277
"but with the mind and therefore..."

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.593
"And therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind."

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.592
You know Shakespeare?

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.636
I had an expensive education.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.600
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's
my favorite play.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.350
Why is that not a surprise?

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.640
I'm sorry?

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.634
Well, all that heartache and pining and...

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.516
So many better things to read.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.749
Like what?

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.278
Well, there are a couple of...

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.034
things in here you could start with.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.512
Are you all right?

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.031
It's wonderful!

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.836
Yes. I suppose it is.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.150
Well, if you like it so much,
then it's yours.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.039
Have you really read every one
of these books?

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.116
What?

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.997
Well, not all of them.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.436
Some of them are in Greek.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.233
Was that a joke?

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.320
Are you making jokes now?

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.795
Maybe.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.275
"The air is blue and keen and cold...

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.472
"and in a frozen sheath, enrolled.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.438
"Each branch, each twig...

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.475
"each blade of grass seems
clad miraculously with...

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.634
"glass."

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.160
I feel as if I'm
seeing it for the first time.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.515
Is there any more?

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.074
Um...

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.193
"But in that solemn silence
is heard the whisper...

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.312
"of every sleeping thing.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.390
"Look. Look at me.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.876
"Come wake me up.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.592
"For still here I be."

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.716
There's something sweet and almost kind

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.280
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.717
And now he's dear and so unsure

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.112
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.315
She glanced this way I thought I saw

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.916
And when we touched
She didn't shudder at my paw

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.915
No, it can't be I'll just ignore

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.958
But then she's never looked at me

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.520
That way before

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.959
New, and a bit alarming

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.394
Who'd have ever thought that this could be

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.996
True that he's no Prince Charming

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:49.191
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.550
- Well, who'd have thought?
- Well, bless my soul!

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.478
- Well, who'd have known?
- Well, who indeed?

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.829
And who'd have guessed

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.639
They'd come together on their own

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.353
It's so peculiar
Wait and see

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.240
We'll wait and see
A few days more

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.677
There may be something there
That wasn't there before

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.078
And here's a thought...

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.038
Perhaps there's something there

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.634
That wasn't there before

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.832
What, Mama?

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:21.837
There may be something there
That wasn't there before

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.550
What is it? What's there?

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.195
I'll tell you when you're older.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.152
Okay, I'm older!

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.278
Chip...

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.432
You are a one.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.479
What are you reading?

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.630
Nothing.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.599
Guinevere and Lancelot.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.439
Well, actually...

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.910
King Arthur and the Round Table.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.039
Knights and men and swords and things.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.270
Mmm.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.875
Still...

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.590
it's a romance.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.915
All right.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.080
I never thanked you for saving my life.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.478
Well, I never thanked you...

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.394
for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.993
They know how to have a good time.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:31.234
Yes. But when I enter the room,
laughter dies.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.400
Me too.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.875
The villagers say that I'm a funny girl...

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.031
but I'm not sure they mean it
as a compliment.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.190
I'm sorry.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.591
Your village sounds terrible.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.110
Almost as lonely as your castle.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.800
What do you say we run away?

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.111
Another little gift from the enchantress.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.599
A book that truly allows you to escape.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.876
How amazing!

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.480
It was her cruelest trick of all.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.231
It was just another curse.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.473
The outside world has no place
for a creature like me...

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.992
but it can for you.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.197
Think of the one place
you've always wanted to see.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.470
Now find it in your mind's eye.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.833
Then feel it in your heart.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.277
Where did you take us?

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.995
Paris.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.831
Oh, I love Paris.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.352
What would you like to see first?

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.670
Notre Dame...

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.678
The Champs-Élysées...

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.870
No?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.992
Too touristy?

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.913
It's so much smaller than I imagined.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.070
This is the Paris of my childhood

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:01.314
These were the borders of my life

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.872
In this crumbling, dusty attic

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.080
Where an artist loved his wife

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.393
Easy to remember

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.309
Harder to move on

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.637
Knowing the Paris of my childhood

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.596
Is gone

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.514
What happened to your mother?

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.957
It was the one story
Papa could never bring himself to tell.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.799
I knew better than to ask.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:48.309
Oh. A doctor's mask.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.034
Plague.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.592
You must leave now.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.556
Quickly...

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.353
before it takes her too.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.473
I'm sorry I ever
called your father a thief.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.674
Let's go home.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.992
This is some storm, huh?

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.391
At least we're not tied to a tree

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.994
in the middle of nowhere...

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.072
surrounded by bloodthirsty wolves.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.038
You know it's not too late.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.389
We could always turn back...

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.710
It's just...

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.315
every time I close my eyes...

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.153
I picture Maurice stranded alone.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.515
And then when I open them...

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.360
he's...

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.592
Maurice!

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.194
Gaston...

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.670
did you try to kill Maurice?

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.679
Maurice!

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.115
Thank heavens!

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.956
I've spent the last five days...

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.032
- trying to find you.
- You tried to kill me.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.873
You left me to the wolves.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.190
Wolves?

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.114
It's one thing to rave
about your delusions.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.510
It's another to accuse me
of attempted murder.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.835
Maurice...

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.075
do you have any proof
of what you're saying?

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.716
Ask Agathe. She rescued me.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.240
Agathe!

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.236
You'd hang your accusations
on the testimony...

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.714
of a filthy hag?

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.917
No offense, Agathe.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.914
Monsieur LeFou.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.080
He was there. He saw it all.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.711
Me?

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.434
You're right.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.398
Don't take my word for it.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.710
LeFou...

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.197
my dearest companion...

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.316
did I...

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.871
your oldest friend
and most loyal compatriot...

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:19.590
try to kill the father
of the only woman I've ever loved?

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.151
Well, it's a complicated question
on a number of accounts...

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.559
But no.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.996
No, he did not.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.270
You...

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.834
Maurice...

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.280
it pains me to say this,

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.080
but you've become a danger
to yourself and others.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.232
No wonder Belle ran away.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.800
You need help, sir.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.520
A place to heal your troubled mind.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.591
Everything's going to be fine.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.000
Just fine.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.115
Well, I saw her in the ballroom...

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.038
and said, "You're making
everything look so beautiful.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.634
"We should have a dance tonight."

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.951
I never imagined she'd actually say yes.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.270
What was I thinking?

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.790
No, Master. It's perfect.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.634
The rose has only four petals left
which means tonight...

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.797
you can tell her how you feel.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.800
I feel like a fool.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.632
She will never love me.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.796
Do not be discouraged.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.634
She is the one.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.110
I wish you'd stop saying that!

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.994
There is no "one."

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.753
You care for her, don't you?

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.674
Well, then, woo her with beautiful music

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.080
and romantic candlelight.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.358
Yes, and when the moment's just right...

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.199
Well, how will I know?

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.874
You will feel slightly nauseous.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.430
Don't worry, Master. You'll do fine.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.751
Just stop being so nervous

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.116
and tell Belle how you feel.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.190
Because if you don't...

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.552
I promise you'll be drinking cold tea
for the rest of your days!

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.319
- In the dark.
- Covered in dust.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.199
Dark and very, very dusty.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.114
Start with the hair.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.998
Women love nice hair!

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.434
I'll take the fingers and toes.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.558
Chapeau, brush those teeth. They need it.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.955
Dip, dip.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.077
Snip, snip.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.519
Polish the nails.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.512
Shine the horns.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.034
Eyes closed. Poof, poof.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.793
And to top it all off...

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.674
Voilà!

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.714
Okay, I can fix this.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.755
Oh! Beautiful!

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.354
But something is missing.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.391
Oh, yes.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.398
The finishing touch.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:57.240
Tale as old as time

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.475
True as it can be

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.960
Barely even friends

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.951
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.999
Just a little change

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.710
Small to say the least

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.114
Both a little scared

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.157
Neither one prepared

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:33.552
Beauty and the Beast

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.273
Ever just the same

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:55.153
Ever a surprise

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.475
Ever as before

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.758
Ever just as sure

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:08.995
As the sun will rise

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:14.596
Tale as old as time

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.439
Tune as old as song

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:26.030
Bittersweet and strange

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.358
Finding you can change

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.911
Learning you were wrong

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.316
Certain as the sun

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.079
Rising in the east

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:58.074
Tale as old as time

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.597
Song as old as rhyme

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.152
Beauty and the Beast

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.551
Tale as old as time

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.918
Song as old as rhyme

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:22.311
Beauty and the Beast

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.554
I haven't danced in years.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.791
I'd almost forgotten the feeling.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.871
It's foolish, I suppose...

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.520
for a creature like me to hope...

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.593
that one day he might earn your affection.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.552
I don't know.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.994
Really?

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.277
You think you could be happy here?

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.279
Can anybody be happy if they aren't free?

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.879
My father taught me to dance.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.353
I used to step on his toes a lot.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.957
You must miss him.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.555
Very much.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.472
Would you like to see him?

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.158
I'd like to see my father.

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.914
Papa!

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.352
What are they doing to him?

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.153
He's in trouble!

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.834
Then you must go to him.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.596
What did you say?

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.871
You must go to him.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.154
No time to waste.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.476
No...

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.193
you keep it with you.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.239
Then you'll always have a way
to look back on me.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.994
Thank you.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.514
Oh...

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.395
Well, Master, I have had my doubts,
but everything is moving like clockwork.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.395
True love really does win the day!

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.834
I let her go.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.599
You what?

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.752
Master, how could you do that?

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.593
I had to.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.271
But why?

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.397
Because he loves her.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.434
Then why are we not human?

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:57.070
Because she doesn't love him.
And now, it's too late.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.277
But she might still come back.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.476
No.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.754
I set her free.

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:07.312
I'm sorry I couldn't do
the same for all of you.

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.119
Now, go.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.476
Our time is almost past.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.280
Come, my love.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.113
I was the one who had it all

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.033
I was the master of my fate

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:34.357
I never needed anybody in my life

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:38.116
I learned the truth too late

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:42.432
I'll never shake away the pain

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.396
I close my eyes but she's still there

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.873
I let her steal into my melancholy heart

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.712
It's more than I can bear

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:05.079
Now I know she'll never leave me

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:09.632
Even as she runs away

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:14.397
She will still torment me
Calm me, hurt me

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.837
Move me, come what may

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.760
Wasting in my lonely tower

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:27.675
Waiting by an open door

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.198
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.040
And be with me for evermore

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.232
I rage against the trials of love

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:48.433
I curse the fading of the light

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.875
Though she's already flown
So far beyond my reach

01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:00.556
She's never out of sight

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.118
Now I know she'll never leave me

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:10.876
Even as she fades from view

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.792
She will still inspire me

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.592
Be a part of everything I do

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:23.554
Wasting in my lonely tower

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.637
Waiting by an open door

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.397
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.518
And as the long, long nights begin

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:41.078
I'll think of all that might have been

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:48.952
Waiting here for evermore

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.476
This man is weak.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.550
Please!

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.639
He needs a hospital...

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.949
not an asylum!

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.359
Have you ever seen the inside
of a mad house, Maurice?

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.432
You wouldn't last a week.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:25.557
Just give me your daughter's hand,
and I'll set you free.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.949
Never.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.599
Take him away!

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.870
Stop!

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.550
Papa.

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.279
Oh, Belle. I thought I'd lost you.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.636
Let him out! He's hurt.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.995
We can't do that, miss.

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.480
But we'll take very good care of him.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.552
My father's not crazy.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.353
Gaston, tell him!

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.238
You know how loyal I am to your family...

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.120
but your father's been making
some unbelievable claims.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.919
It's true, Belle.

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.515
He's been raving about a beast...

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:15.556
in a castle!

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.439
I've just come from the castle
and there is a beast!

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.632
You'd say anything to set him free.
Your word is hardly proof.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.319
You want proof?

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.953
Show me the Beast!

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.240
There's your proof.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:40.870
This is sorcery!

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.840
Look at this beast!

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.314
Look at his fangs!

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:49.589
His claws!

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.030
No. Don't be afraid.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.431
He's gentle and kind.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:59.274
The monster has her under his spell.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.755
If I didn't know better,

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.355
I'd say she even cared for him!

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.552
He's not a monster, Gaston.

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.836
You are!

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.200
The Beast wouldn't hurt anyone.

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.158
I've heard of the effects of dark magic...

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.159
but I've never before seen it
with my own eyes!

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.193
This is a threat to our very existence!

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.716
We can't have her
running off to warn the beast.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.995
Lock her up too.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.600
- No!
- Come here!

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.239
Shut up!

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.356
You won't get away with this, Gaston!

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.196
Oh, Belle!

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.872
Gaston, with all due respect...

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.673
Do you want to be next?

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.029
Fetch my horse.

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.480
Stand guard!

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.710
Don't let them escape.

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.315
This creature will curse us all
if we don't stop him.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.759
Well, I say, we kill the beast!

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.910
Kill the beast!

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.034
We're not safe until he's dead

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.879
He'll come stalking us at night

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.192
Set to sacrifice our children
To his monstrous appetite

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.999
He'll wreak havoc on our village

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.514
If we let him wander free

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.077
So it's time to take some action, boys

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.634
It's time to follow me

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.829
Through the mist, through the wood
Through the darkness and the shadows

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.231
It's a nightmare
But it's one exciting ride

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.831
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.391
And there's something
truly terrible inside

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.194
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.552
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.319
Hear him roar, see him foam

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:36.030
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.236
Good and dead

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.714
Kill the beast!

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.719
Light your torch, mount your horse

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.439
Screw your courage to the sticking place

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.877
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.032
Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.238
For in times like this
They'll do just as I say

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.632
There's a beast running wild
There's no question

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.918
But I fear the wrong monster's released

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.596
Sally forth, tally ho
Grab your sword, grab your bow

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:08.959
Praise the Lord, and here we go

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:13.913
Show me the castle.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.119
At least he has finally learned to love.

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.239
A lot of good that does us
if she doesn't love him in return.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.679
No. This is the first time
I've had any real hope she would.

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.593
Did you hear that, Mama?

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.160
Is it her? Is she coming back?

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.430
Could it be?

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.114
I told you!

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.475
Sacré bleu!

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.920
Invaders!

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.229
Ruffians!

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.232
Well, there you go.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.471
So much for true love.

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.279
Man the barricades...

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.274
and hold fast!

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.635
Move aside!

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.832
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:52.794
Unafraid, although
the danger's just increased

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.798
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.953
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.315
Let's kill the beast!

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.200
We need help.

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.070
- I have to warn the Beast.
- Warn him?

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.152
How did you get away from him?

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.472
He let me go, Papa.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:20.793
He sent me back to you.

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.872
I don't understand.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.480
Where did you...

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.996
He took me there.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.795
I know what happened to Maman.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.595
Then you know
why I had to leave her there.

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.796
I had to protect you.

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.119
I've always tried to protect
my little girl.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.600
Probably too much.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.312
I understand.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.474
Will you help me now?

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.512
It's dangerous.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:02.830
Yes.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.714
Yes, it is.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.112
I could try to pick the lock.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.916
After all...

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.954
it's only gears and springs.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.438
But I would need...

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.120
something long and sharp.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.390
Like that.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.040
Perfect.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:32.914
Oh, excuse me, Master.

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.753
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.474
She's not coming back.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.596
No.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.757
They're breaking down the doors!

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.477
Doesn't matter now.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:46.155
Just let them come.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.960
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.355
This isn't working!

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.676
I know what to do.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.076
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.193
Kill the beast!

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.951
Are you not the least bit concerned...

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.918
that this castle might be haunted?

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.756
Don't lose your nerve, LeFou.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.116
Where are we?

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:18.834
This place seems familiar.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.992
Like I've been here before.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.115
Oh, hello, there.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.599
You must be the talking tea cup.

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.356
And you must be...

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.709
his grandmother.

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.672
Grandmother?

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.957
Attack!

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.359
Oh, hello!

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.075
Gaston!

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.115
Gaston.

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:00.310
Help.

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.834
Sorry, old friend.

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.193
It's hero time.

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:05.715
Ooh, ouch!

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.316
Hello.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.680
Oh, uh... I believe this is yours.

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.230
She's very headstrong.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.395
Do you have children?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.038
No one to protect you now, huh?

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.390
One, two, three, four...

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.711
five, six, seven, eight...

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:00.916
Good show, Chip, my boy.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.553
Excellent!

01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.751
The infantry's arrived.

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.437
Now, go and teach them a lesson. Go.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:13.349
Yes, those are called books,
you third rate musketeers.

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.394
Oh! I'm off.

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.911
Just a clock.

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.277
Come here...

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:29.794
little boys.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.277
I spin you this way. I put it on.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:36.559
Yes, pretty little boys. Yes!

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.113
Beautiful!

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:41.272
Go, be free!

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.794
Be free. Be free!

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.359
How do you like your tea?

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.954
Piping hot?

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.998
Or boiling?

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.476
Oh!

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:04.240
Mr. Potts!

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.430
Mama!

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.234
Thank you!

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.035
Take that!

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:18.714
Nicely handled!

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.280
Well, I used to be on Gaston's side...

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.113
but we are so in a bad place right now.

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.636
- You're too good for him, anyway.
- Yeah.

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:25.995
Should we get back to it, then?

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.154
Such sweet music.

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.159
- Stand back.
- Silence that harpsichord!

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.352
- What? Uh-oh!
- Maestro!

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.755
Darling! At last!

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.837
I'm coming, my love.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.918
This is it!

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:45.112
The fat lady is singing.

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:51.195
Bravissima!

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.757
Watch your toes!

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.510
That's it! Go! Go!

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:07.076
Bon voyage.

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.479
Safe trip home.

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.199
And stay out!

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.920
Hello, beast.

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.793
I'm Gaston.

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.279
Belle sent me.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.270
Are you in love with her?

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.914
Did you honestly think she'd want you?

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:10.950
Belle!

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.398
Where is he?

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.960
When we return to the village...

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:17.673
you will marry me.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.559
And that beast's head...

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:21.597
- will hang on our wall.
- Never!

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.234
I'm coming for you, beast.

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.715
- No!
- Belle?

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.236
Belle!

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:10.556
You came back!

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:13.554
- I tried to stop them!
- Stay there!

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.150
I'm coming.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.835
Gaston!

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:45.076
No!

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.872
Don't let me go.

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.520
Please.

01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.433
I'll do anything.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.914
Don't hurt me, beast.

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:16.919
I am not...

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.514
a beast.

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.634
Go!

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.672
Get out!

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.870
Don't!

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.280
It's too far!

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:50.676
Please!

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.195
Come on.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.154
You came back.

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.317
Of course I came back.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:30.880
I'll never leave you again.

01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.836
I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:35.440
We're together now.

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.839
It's gonna be fine.

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.270
At least I got to see you.

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.671
One last time.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.234
No!

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.680
Please, no.

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.435
Come back.

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.559
We did it, Plumette!

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:06.951
Victory is ours.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.631
- Oh...
- Plumette?

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.800
Plumette?

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.120
Oh, my darling, Plumette.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.554
Oh, no.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.239
Maestro, you were so brave.

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.997
Goodbye, my love.

01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.640
Amore.

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.839
No! Don't leave me!

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.315
Chip!

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:51.949
Chip!

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:54.640
Have you seen Chip? He ran off.

01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.876
Where is my little boy?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.798
- Mama!
- Oh, no!

01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.394
Mom!

01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:24.996
Lumière...

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.754
I can't...

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:27.870
speak.

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.553
It's all right, Cogsworth.

01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:30.670
I can't...

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.390
Lumière...

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:33.916
my friend.

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:36.271
It was an honor to serve...

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.510
with you.

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.795
The honor was mine.

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.920
Come back.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.634
Please don't leave me.

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:18.991
I love you.

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.831
Oh. Maestro!

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.314
Madame!

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.240
Maestro!

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.476
Ooh.

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:06.389
- Lumière!
- Ah?

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:09.030
Cogsworth, we beat the clock!

01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.316
Mon ami!

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:14.550
Plumette!

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:18.032
Plumette!

01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:21.720
Oh. Mon amour.

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:25.630
Oh.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.753
Oh. Oh.

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.352
Chip! Look at you!

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:48.600
You're a little boy again!

01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.877
What did I tell you, darling?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.753
You smell so good!

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:01.710
Froufrou, finalmente!

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.430
Darling?

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.559
Oh! Mr. Potts!

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:08.677
Beatrice! I remember!

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.069
I do!

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.316
Henry?

01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:18.796
Henry!

01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:20.519
Oh! Oh, dear.

01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.236
Oh!

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.439
I've been so lonely.

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.319
Turn back into a clock.

01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:29.034
Turn back into a clock.

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.391
Lumière, look!

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.354
Oh, my Prince!

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.719
Hello, old friend.

01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:42.029
Oh! It's so good to see you.

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.793
You saved our lives, mademoiselle.

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.434
Belle! It's me!

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.114
It's Chip!

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.592
Tale as old as time

01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:59.879
Tune as old as song

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:04.671
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:10.313
Learning you were wrong

01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:31.511
Winter turns to spring

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.196
Famine turns to feast

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:39.751
Nature points the way

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:42.833
Nothing left to say

01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:48.916
Beauty and the Beast

01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:53.916
What? What is it?

01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.276
How would you feel about growing a beard?

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.350
Certain as the sun

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:11.639
Rising in the east

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:14.360
Tale as old as time

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.155
Song as old as rhyme

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:20.478
Beauty and the Beast

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.552
Tale as old as time

01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:29.957
Song as old as rhyme

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.791
Beauty and the Beast

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:20.280
How does a moment last forever?

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:24.150
How can a story never die?

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.439
It is love we must hold on to

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:32.680
Never easy but we try

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:37.156
Sometimes our happiness is captured

01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:42.313
Somehow a time and place stand still

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:46.269
Love lives on inside our hearts

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:50.036
And always will

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:55.194
Minutes turn to hours

01:59:55.360 --> 02:00:00.276
Days to years then gone

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:04.275
But when all else has been forgotten

02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:10.554
Still our song lives on

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:16.439
Maybe some moments weren't so perfect

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:20.236
Maybe some memories not so sweet

02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:24.639
But we have to know some bad times

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:29.357
Or our lives are incomplete

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.036
Then when shadows overtake us

02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:37.720
Just when we feel all hope is gone

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:41.999
We'll hear our song and know once more

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:46.200
Our love lives on

02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:57.958
Oh, oh

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:12.754
How does a moment last forever?

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:16.231
How does our happiness endure?

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.996
Through the darkest of our troubles

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:25.110
Love is beauty, love is pure

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.115
Love pays no mind to desolation

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.115
It flows like a river through the soul

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.320
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:41.872
And makes us whole

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.960
Minutes turn to hours

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:50.353
Days to years then gone

02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:56.797
But when all else has been forgotten

02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:03.954
Still our song lives on

02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:10.199
How does a moment last forever

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:18.038
When our song lives on

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:48.040
Ah

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:58.153
Tale as old as time

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.952
True as it can be

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:08.479
Barely even friends

02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:15.638
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:22.076
Just a little change

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:26.192
Small to say the least

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.080
Both a little scared

02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.074
Neither one prepared

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.951
Beauty and the Beast

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:43.394
Ever just the same

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:49.752
Ever a surprise

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.355
Ever as before

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.638
And ever just as sure

02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:00.238
As the sun will rise

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:03.757
Oh

02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:10.434
Hey

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:15.790
Ah

02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:20.916
Ooh

02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:25.079
Uh-huh

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:29.473
Ever just the same

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.272
And ever a surprise

02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:39.759
Ever as before

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:42.754
And ever just as sure

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:47.358
As the sun will rise

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.190
Oh, oh, oh

02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:56.150
Tale as old as time

02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:01.951
Tune as old as song

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.679
Oh

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:07.274
Bittersweet and strange

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:10.274
Finding you can change

02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:13.154
Learning you were wrong

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:19.074
Certain as the sun

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:22.159
Certain as the sun

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.880
Rising in the east

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.760
Tale as old as time

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.879
Song as old as rhyme

02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:35.393
Beauty and the Beast

02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:39.640
Tale as old as time

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:42.833
Song as old as rhyme

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:49.998
Beauty and the Beast

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:22.190
I was the one who had it all

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.354
I was the master of my fate

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.631
I never needed anybody in my life

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:37.352
I learned the truth too late

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:41.912
I'll never shake away the pain

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:46.992
I close my eyes but she's still there

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:51.831
I let her steal into my melancholy heart

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:57.593
It's more than I can bear

02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:03.320
Now I know she'll never leave me

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:07.952
Even as she runs away

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:12.717
She will still torment me Calm me, hurt me

02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:16.874
Move me, come what may

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:21.798
Wasting in my lonely tower

02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:26.830
Waiting by an open door

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:31.320
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:37.594
And be with me for evermore

02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:43.315
I rage against the trials of love

02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:47.914
I curse the fading of the light

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:52.593
Though she's already flown
So far beyond my reach

02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:58.798
She's never out of sight

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:03.637
Now I know she'll never leave me

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:08.353
Even as she fades from view

02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:11.035
She will still inspire me

02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:16.838
Be a part of everything I do

02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:21.999
Wasting in my lonely tower

02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:27.117
Waiting by an open door

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:30.956
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:35.390
And as the long, long nights begin

02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:39.915
I'll think of all that might have been

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:47.078
Waiting here for evermore
