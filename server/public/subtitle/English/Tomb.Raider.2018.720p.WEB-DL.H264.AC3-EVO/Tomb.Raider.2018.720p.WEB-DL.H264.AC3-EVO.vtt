00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:55.343
<i>May 17th, 2009.</i>

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:57.978
<i>Further research on Himiko.</i>

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.483
<i>According to legend, Himiko,
the first queen of Japan,</i>

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:04.286
<i>was a powerful sorceress</i>

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:07.822
<i>who ruled her empire
through dark magic,</i>

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:09.958
<i>spreading death
and destruction</i>

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.859
<i>by the mere touch of her hand.</i>

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:16.264
<i>She was only stopped
by a single twist of fate.</i>

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:20.635
<i>An army of her own generals
bound and dragged Himiko</i>

00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:22.704
<i>to an uninhabitable island</i>

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:25.806
<i>in the middle of
the treacherous Devil's Sea.</i>

00:01:25.808 --> 00:01:31.213
<i>There, she remains entombed
beneath the mountains.</i>

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:35.951
<i>I found a speck on an old map
that no one else has.</i>

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:37.784
<i>And she's there,</i>

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:39.589
<i>waiting to be unleashed.</i>

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:44.993
<i>I have to get there first.</i>

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:46.826
<i>Even if it means
doing the last thing</i>

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:49.496
<i>I'd ever want to do...</i>

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:52.536
<i>Leaving my Lara behind.</i>

00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:56.003
<i>You gotta
make decisions, Lara.</i>

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:57.504
You gotta make
something happen.

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:04.811
Counter-punching
doesn't work for you.

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:06.480
You don't have the skill.

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:08.118
- Thanks, Terry.
- You're welcome.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.788
Come on, Lara!

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:17.661
Stop dancing, start fighting.

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:21.332
Yes, girl!

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.501
Come on!

00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:36.147
Nice one, Lara!
You've got this!

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:42.384
- It's over.
- Isn't!

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:43.951
Then get out of it!

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:52.929
Come on, Lara! Tap out.

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:14.481
Don't say it.

00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:16.117
You got whupped, girl.
You got whupped.

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.356
- Not whupped.
- Okay. Not whupped.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:22.057
Marmalized.

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:26.759
"Marmalized"? She's not
a freakin' superhero.

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:29.496
Truth is, I let her...

00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:30.867
We cool?

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:33.237
Yeah, we're cool.

00:03:36.373 --> 00:03:38.140
Was fun actually!

00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:39.210
Thanks.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.815
I'll get you next time.

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:48.082
I'll marmalize you.

00:03:50.053 --> 00:03:51.485
You're home early
tonight, right?

00:03:51.487 --> 00:03:53.454
Yup.

00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:55.256
Catch you later.

00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:56.456
Laters.

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:58.694
Hey! Who stole my apple?

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:04.165
Should've known it was you.

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:05.999
Why would I do
a thing like that?

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.336
'Cause you can't afford
your own.

00:04:08.338 --> 00:04:10.372
Just seen you're behind
with your payments.

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:12.740
Terry, look, I'll catch up
on the payments, I promise.

00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:14.611
I'll make it up to you.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.048
Get a job, Lara.

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:21.814
Do you think I'm dressed
like this for fun?

00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:25.156
I like you, Lara.
I really do, but...

00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:05.793
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:08.029
- All good?
- Yeah. Havin' a great day.

00:05:08.031 --> 00:05:09.033
You?

00:05:10.334 --> 00:05:12.166
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:05:12.168 --> 00:05:15.804
Ask her more. Ask her for
dinner or something. Do it.

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:17.471
Come on.

00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:18.674
Anything else?

00:05:20.144 --> 00:05:21.778
No, no, no.

00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:29.284
What is your problem?
Why didn't you ask her?

00:05:29.286 --> 00:05:30.686
Stupid boy.

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:41.862
You got that fox hunt
sorted, Rog?

00:05:41.864 --> 00:05:43.831
Yeah, more or less.

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.867
Got 30 hounds signed up.
Just gotta find a fox now.

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:48.836
- Tough one, that.
- Mmm.

00:05:48.838 --> 00:05:50.371
Need someone quick enough
to make it interesting.

00:05:50.373 --> 00:05:52.207
Yeah. No fun
if they ain't quick.

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:53.974
But dumb enough
to think they can win.

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:55.909
What are you two plotting?

00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:58.145
We're gonna do a fox hunt.

00:05:58.147 --> 00:06:00.015
- A what?
- Well, it's like a race.

00:06:00.017 --> 00:06:01.781
Except the fox gets
a head start,

00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:03.318
leavin' a paint trail
behind his bike.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.884
For the baying hounds
to follow.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.653
And if they haven't caught him

00:06:06.655 --> 00:06:07.989
by the time
the paint runs out...

00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:09.111
He wins all the money.

00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:11.492
How much money?

00:06:11.494 --> 00:06:13.163
600 quid.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.797
I think you just
found yourself a fox.

00:06:20.703 --> 00:06:22.102
Oh, you're bein' serious?

00:06:22.104 --> 00:06:23.737
Not quick or dumb enough
for you?

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:25.409
No, I mean, I just...

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:28.909
You're on.

00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.877
"Hide fox, and all after!"

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.914
Ooh, Shakespeare?

00:06:32.916 --> 00:06:34.816
<i>Hamlet,</i> is it?

00:06:34.818 --> 00:06:36.682
Don't know.
Things just stick in my brain.

00:06:36.684 --> 00:06:38.352
You know it's <i>Hamlet.</i>

00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:39.955
And I ask you once again,

00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:42.190
why on earth
are you a bike courier?

00:06:42.192 --> 00:06:43.394
You, Bruce.

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:47.096
I wanna be close to you.

00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:19.692
Five, four, three,
two, one! Go!

00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:30.407
Hey!

00:07:53.096 --> 00:07:55.365
Excuse me!

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:22.891
Go, go, go!

00:08:25.127 --> 00:08:27.029
Where is she, bro?

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.473
<i>I won't be long,
my love.</i>

00:09:24.253 --> 00:09:27.587
- Oi! Watch where you're going!
- Use your mirrors!

00:09:35.564 --> 00:09:37.664
Go! Go!

00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:48.144
Fancy seeing you here.

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:50.777
Ana.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:52.313
You didn't have to come.

00:09:52.315 --> 00:09:54.547
I don't need
a guardian anymore.

00:09:54.549 --> 00:09:55.985
Really?

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.156
Have you been decorating?

00:10:03.193 --> 00:10:05.226
Haven't seen you
for a long time.

00:10:05.228 --> 00:10:07.330
You've never seen me.

00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:13.304
I'm sorry.

00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:16.704
Thanks for coming.

00:10:17.073 --> 00:10:18.708
What was today about?

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:21.642
I needed the money.

00:10:21.644 --> 00:10:24.245
No, you don't.
There's an inheritance

00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:25.947
waiting for you
if only you would step...

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:27.151
I won't.

00:10:29.252 --> 00:10:31.321
It's been seven years, Lara.

00:10:33.555 --> 00:10:36.590
Tokyo police stopped looking
for your father

00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:39.059
five years ago.

00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:42.631
Private investigators won't
even take our money anymore.

00:10:43.565 --> 00:10:45.933
I know it's difficult
to accept.

00:10:45.935 --> 00:10:48.936
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.

00:10:48.938 --> 00:10:51.939
Hmm. That's why you came.

00:10:51.941 --> 00:10:55.442
No. I came for you.

00:10:55.444 --> 00:10:57.677
Just think what you can do
for the world,

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:59.778
with your potential,
with your wealth.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.085
His wealth. Not mine.

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:07.488
Listen, it's very simple...

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.623
If you don't sign the papers,

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:13.726
then everything your father
worked for will be sold off.

00:11:13.728 --> 00:11:15.598
Not just the company,

00:11:16.832 --> 00:11:18.701
but Croft Manor, also.

00:11:21.502 --> 00:11:24.773
Can you imagine how he would
feel if you lost the house?

00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:33.280
Lara, your father's gone.

00:11:33.282 --> 00:11:36.518
But you can pick up
where he left off.

00:11:37.752 --> 00:11:39.288
It's in your blood.

00:11:44.593 --> 00:11:45.727
I'm sorry.

00:11:47.263 --> 00:11:49.699
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.

00:12:07.817 --> 00:12:10.817
<i>But I don't
want you to go, Daddy.</i>

00:12:10.819 --> 00:12:12.588
I won't be long, my love.

00:12:14.357 --> 00:12:16.357
You must understand.

00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:20.260
We Crofts, we have
responsibilities, jobs to do.

00:12:20.262 --> 00:12:21.962
But I'll miss you.

00:12:21.964 --> 00:12:24.464
I know. I'll miss you, too.

00:12:24.466 --> 00:12:26.469
But I may have
a solution to that.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.436
See this?

00:12:29.438 --> 00:12:32.273
This was your mother's,
so it has special powers.

00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:34.141
What do you mean?

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:35.909
Ever you want to feel close
to someone,

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:38.512
just put it in your hand,
and you hold it tightly.

00:12:38.514 --> 00:12:41.715
And you think of that person,
and they'll know.

00:12:41.717 --> 00:12:43.387
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:12:44.253 --> 00:12:45.953
It's magic.

00:12:45.955 --> 00:12:48.055
And it means
that we'll always be together,

00:12:48.057 --> 00:12:49.891
wherever I am.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.261
Okay?

00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:01.404
I'll be back
before you know I'm gone.

00:13:30.065 --> 00:13:31.267
Oi!

00:13:32.301 --> 00:13:34.034
Couriers round the back.

00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:36.272
Uh, I'm not a courier.

00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:38.371
Well, I am.

00:13:38.373 --> 00:13:40.843
Right. So round the back.

00:13:47.883 --> 00:13:49.816
I'm here to see Ana Miller.

00:13:49.818 --> 00:13:52.386
Well, you gotta
sign in like everyone else.

00:13:52.388 --> 00:13:53.854
What's your name?

00:13:53.856 --> 00:13:55.688
Lara.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.091
Lara.

00:13:57.093 --> 00:13:58.660
Croft.

00:14:02.564 --> 00:14:05.299
The pages
that require a signature

00:14:05.301 --> 00:14:08.204
are marked
for your convenience.

00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:11.338
Would you like Mr. Yaffe

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.740
to take you
through the particulars?

00:14:13.142 --> 00:14:15.179
I gather I sign

00:14:16.912 --> 00:14:18.644
and Dad is dead.

00:14:18.646 --> 00:14:21.783
I can imagine
how difficult this is for you.

00:14:24.786 --> 00:14:26.454
I miss him, too.

00:14:42.338 --> 00:14:44.005
That was Dad's.

00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:47.173
Yes, Miss Croft.
According to Richard's will,

00:14:47.175 --> 00:14:49.910
in the event of his death

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:51.611
I was to give it to you.

00:14:51.613 --> 00:14:55.418
<i>Karakuri.</i> Japanese puzzle.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.218
Um, technically speaking,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.855
you're meant to sign
the papers first.

00:15:05.127 --> 00:15:06.826
I could never understand

00:15:06.828 --> 00:15:09.163
your father's obsession
with those things.

00:15:09.165 --> 00:15:11.265
Wouldn't believe
how many of these

00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:12.831
were lying around the house.

00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:14.968
There was gonna be
some purpose to it.

00:15:47.703 --> 00:15:51.471
"The first letter
from my final destination."

00:15:51.473 --> 00:15:54.344
But he didn't leave a letter.

00:16:01.683 --> 00:16:04.320
- If you'll excuse me.
- Lara, I...

00:16:53.335 --> 00:16:55.537
"My final destination."

00:17:03.345 --> 00:17:05.082
The first letter.

00:18:06.308 --> 00:18:07.542
What the...

00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:35.603
Dad, what were you up to?

00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:50.150
<i>Hello, sprout.</i>

00:18:50.152 --> 00:18:52.718
<i>I knew I could trust you
to solve my puzzle.</i>

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.688
<i>Unfortunately, if you're
watching this tape,</i>

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.860
<i>then, uh, it means
that I must be dead.</i>

00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:01.695
<i>It'll be obvious to you by now</i>

00:19:01.697 --> 00:19:03.697
<i>that there was more to my life</i>

00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:05.764
<i>than just boardrooms
and business deals.</i>

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:08.936
<i>Things that I couldn't
tell you about before.</i>

00:19:08.938 --> 00:19:13.040
<i>When your mother died,
grief nearly destroyed me.</i>

00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:15.109
<i>I began searching the world,</i>

00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:19.213
<i>desperate for a hint
of another realm,</i>

00:19:19.215 --> 00:19:23.284
<i>for proof that
the supernatural is real.</i>

00:19:23.286 --> 00:19:27.055
<i>Anything to feel her
with me again.</i>

00:19:27.756 --> 00:19:30.625
<i>I made quite
a hobby of it, sprout.</i>

00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:33.326
<i>Now...</i>

00:19:33.328 --> 00:19:35.295
<i>I need you to do me a favor.</i>

00:19:35.297 --> 00:19:38.430
<i>I need you to burn
all my research</i>

00:19:38.432 --> 00:19:39.698
<i>on the Himiko project.</i>

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.635
<i>Just burn all of it.</i>

00:19:41.637 --> 00:19:43.204
<i>The notebooks,
the tapes, everything.</i>

00:19:43.206 --> 00:19:44.906
<i>It's very important.</i>

00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:46.540
<i>If it falls
into the wrong hands,</i>

00:19:46.542 --> 00:19:47.975
<i>then it could be catastrophic,</i>

00:19:47.977 --> 00:19:50.178
<i>so please do it straightaway.</i>

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.478
<i>I know you hate
being told what to do,</i>

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.184
<i>but please promise me that.</i>

00:19:56.186 --> 00:19:59.188
<i>I hope you never
have to see this tape.</i>

00:19:59.688 --> 00:20:02.223
<i>But if you do,</i>

00:20:02.225 --> 00:20:04.727
<i>you've found
my secret calling.</i>

00:20:07.229 --> 00:20:09.065
<i>I hope you find yours.</i>

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.539
Dad loves you.

00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:42.265
"Himiko."

00:20:52.107 --> 00:20:54.140
<i>October 5th.</i>

00:20:54.142 --> 00:20:56.944
<i>They called Queen Himiko
the "Mother of Death."</i>

00:20:56.946 --> 00:20:58.844
<i>All the stories about her</i>

00:20:58.846 --> 00:21:00.780
<i>end in rivers
running red with blood.</i>

00:21:00.782 --> 00:21:03.985
<i>Bewitching people,
controlling minds,</i>

00:21:03.987 --> 00:21:05.851
<i>spreading death
and destruction</i>

00:21:05.853 --> 00:21:07.520
<i>with just
the touch of her hand.</i>

00:21:07.522 --> 00:21:09.488
<i>The bloodshed only ended</i>

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.159
<i>when her own generals
buried her alive in a tomb,</i>

00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:14.427
<i>sealing her away
from the outside world,</i>

00:21:14.429 --> 00:21:17.098
<i>on an island
no one could reach.</i>

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.666
<i>History's all but erased
its existence.</i>

00:21:20.668 --> 00:21:23.339
<i>The lost island of Yamatai.</i>

00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:26.375
<i>I'm certain this is the place.</i>

00:21:27.775 --> 00:21:30.577
<i>July 29th, 2011.</i>

00:21:30.579 --> 00:21:32.312
<i>I finally found a captain</i>

00:21:32.314 --> 00:21:34.348
<i>willing to take me
to the island.</i>

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.118
<i>I must get there first
to ensure her powers</i>

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.021
<i>will never fall
into the wrong hands.</i>

00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:58.072
Uh...

00:21:58.074 --> 00:22:00.473
That amulet was given
to my father

00:22:00.475 --> 00:22:03.412
by Emperor Showa of Japan.

00:22:03.844 --> 00:22:06.112
Right. Right. Well...

00:22:06.114 --> 00:22:08.613
This ain't from Japan.

00:22:08.615 --> 00:22:10.317
You're correct.

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:12.085
Emperor Showa
was given it by the grandson

00:22:12.087 --> 00:22:13.852
of the former emperor
of Maratha.

00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:16.856
"Maratha"? You're having
a laugh, in't ya?

00:22:16.858 --> 00:22:18.658
And he, himself,
got it from Thibaw,

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.026
the last king of Burma

00:22:20.028 --> 00:22:21.861
when he was exiled in India.

00:22:21.863 --> 00:22:23.896
- "Exiled in India."
- Mmm.

00:22:23.898 --> 00:22:25.764
What a fascinating tale.

00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:27.832
And you got
all this, uh, provenance

00:22:27.834 --> 00:22:29.468
down on paper, do ya?

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.170
If I had
the provenance on paper,

00:22:31.172 --> 00:22:33.239
I'd be at Christie's,
wouldn't I?

00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:35.409
But, um...

00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:37.311
This is your lucky day.

00:22:37.313 --> 00:22:38.844
Is it?

00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:40.413
Alan!
What have I told you

00:22:40.415 --> 00:22:42.416
about flirting
with the customers?

00:22:42.418 --> 00:22:43.984
I'm not flirting. I'm just
naturally charismatic.

00:22:43.986 --> 00:22:45.388
I was not flirting. I'm sorry.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.554
I was flirting.

00:22:48.556 --> 00:22:49.891
Have a look.

00:22:57.733 --> 00:22:59.898
Big smiles, nice and casual.

00:22:59.901 --> 00:23:01.802
Right, well,
I'm pleased to say

00:23:01.804 --> 00:23:04.207
we're in a position
to make you an offer.

00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:07.443
Ten.

00:23:10.379 --> 00:23:11.780
Please?

00:23:12.914 --> 00:23:14.715
Just a tad bit more.

00:23:14.717 --> 00:23:16.849
That's all I have
to remember my dad by.

00:23:16.851 --> 00:23:19.585
Oh. Oh, your dad died.

00:23:19.587 --> 00:23:22.188
That's a shame.
It's a terrible thing

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.957
for a young woman
to lose her father.

00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:26.127
Really. All right.
Fair enough.

00:23:26.129 --> 00:23:27.862
9,000.

00:23:28.296 --> 00:23:29.527
You just said 10.

00:23:29.529 --> 00:23:31.098
Well, people come in here

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.864
trying the dead dad shit
all the time.

00:23:32.866 --> 00:23:34.434
And you fall for it
all the time.

00:23:34.436 --> 00:23:36.236
I don't fall for it
all the time.

00:23:36.238 --> 00:23:37.637
Last week,
you fell for it twice.

00:23:37.639 --> 00:23:38.771
I fell for it twice.

00:23:38.773 --> 00:23:40.505
It's the truth.

00:23:40.507 --> 00:23:42.243
Fine. I'm happy
to keep negotiating.

00:23:42.245 --> 00:23:43.445
Because now
the price is eight.

00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:47.847
- Okay. You win.
- Ah, finally.

00:23:47.849 --> 00:23:50.082
Thank you. Really.

00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:51.850
Thank you.

00:23:51.852 --> 00:23:54.456
For just
such occasions.

00:23:57.458 --> 00:23:59.492
For just such occasions.

00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:00.994
You burnt me taters!

00:24:00.996 --> 00:24:02.396
Sort yourself out, Alan.
Seriously.

00:24:02.398 --> 00:24:03.398
That is hot coffee.

00:24:38.401 --> 00:24:40.967
Excuse me,
do you speak English?

00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:42.804
Sorry, no.

00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:45.942
No? Thank you.

00:24:47.775 --> 00:24:49.609
Sorry. Excuse me.

00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:53.514
Do you know a Lu Ren? Lu Ren?

00:24:53.847 --> 00:24:55.850
Not even a tiny bit?

00:24:59.354 --> 00:25:01.687
- Do you speak English?
- Lady.

00:25:01.689 --> 00:25:02.991
You need help?

00:25:04.558 --> 00:25:07.194
Yes. I do.

00:25:07.196 --> 00:25:10.965
I'm looking
for this guy called Lu Ren.

00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:12.698
Um, he's supposed to...

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.801
- Lu Ren boat.
- Yes.

00:25:14.803 --> 00:25:16.269
<i>Endurance.</i> Over there.

00:25:16.271 --> 00:25:17.940
<i>"Endurance"?</i> Which one?

00:25:20.176 --> 00:25:21.311
Oi!

00:25:22.577 --> 00:25:23.912
Wait!

00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:22.034
Stay back.

00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:27.642
Gimme the bag.

00:26:40.589 --> 00:26:41.991
You just lost your tip.

00:26:44.026 --> 00:26:45.427
You just lose your tongue.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.434
Lu! Lu Ren!

00:27:27.436 --> 00:27:29.171
Help! Help!

00:27:44.452 --> 00:27:46.487
Run! Run! He's drunk again!

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:52.061
Thank you.

00:27:55.663 --> 00:27:57.428
What?

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.032
I said what
are you doing on my boat?

00:27:59.034 --> 00:28:00.632
I'm not with them.

00:28:00.634 --> 00:28:02.668
I'm looking for a man
named Lu Ren.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.438
Congratulations, you found me.
Now get lost.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.376
Please. Wait.
Just listen. I need...

00:28:09.378 --> 00:28:11.111
Okay, let's go.

00:28:11.113 --> 00:28:12.211
I'm not here
to make any trouble.

00:28:12.213 --> 00:28:14.114
Keep walking.

00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:16.015
Could you please
put that gun down and just...

00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:21.324
Oh, for God's sake.

00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:28.427
My father, Richard Croft,
tried to buy a boat from you.

00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:31.563
No. No. Not me, he didn't.

00:28:31.565 --> 00:28:32.800
Yes, he did.

00:28:34.402 --> 00:28:37.271
Your name is Lu Ren.

00:28:37.273 --> 00:28:39.208
This is from you.

00:28:39.874 --> 00:28:43.876
Yes, I know my name, thanks.

00:28:43.878 --> 00:28:47.913
It's the same as my father's,
and he wrote that, not me.

00:28:50.352 --> 00:28:52.319
Well, then I need
to talk to him.

00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:54.353
You and 100 other people
he owed money...

00:28:54.355 --> 00:28:57.556
- Where is he?
- I don't know, okay?

00:28:57.558 --> 00:28:59.559
One day,
he just left on his boat,

00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:02.198
and I never saw him again,
all right?

00:29:05.267 --> 00:29:07.303
Was this seven years ago?

00:29:11.439 --> 00:29:15.374
I think I know
where they went. Our dads.

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:18.344
To the bottom
of the sea?

00:29:18.346 --> 00:29:21.647
They were headed
to an uninhabited island.

00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:24.383
Somewhere off the coast
of Japan.

00:29:24.385 --> 00:29:26.554
It used to be called Yamatai.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.456
I'm gonna go there
and find out

00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:31.992
what happened to them.

00:29:31.994 --> 00:29:33.626
Good luck. There's at least

00:29:33.628 --> 00:29:35.427
6,000 islands
off the coast of Japan,

00:29:35.429 --> 00:29:37.397
and hardly any of them
are populated.

00:29:37.399 --> 00:29:39.431
Well, I have a map.

00:29:39.433 --> 00:29:42.902
Now, all I need to do is to
figure out what these are.

00:29:42.904 --> 00:29:45.373
I think these are coordinates.

00:29:45.672 --> 00:29:47.242
The location.

00:29:51.979 --> 00:29:53.780
They're clock hands.

00:29:54.582 --> 00:29:57.516
They're not
clock hands.

00:29:57.518 --> 00:29:59.887
Definitely not
clock hands. They're...

00:30:04.824 --> 00:30:06.727
They are clock hands.

00:30:13.801 --> 00:30:15.238
Three...

00:30:20.342 --> 00:30:22.675
That's the one.

00:30:22.677 --> 00:30:25.744
That's right in the middle
of the Devil's Sea.

00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:27.346
You might as well
tie a stone to your foot

00:30:27.348 --> 00:30:28.880
and jump off the boat now.

00:30:28.882 --> 00:30:30.482
It'll be an adventure.

00:30:30.484 --> 00:30:33.919
Death is not an adventure.

00:30:33.921 --> 00:30:35.754
Don't you want to know
what happened to them?

00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:39.491
I just don't care
anymore, okay?

00:30:39.493 --> 00:30:42.298
Look, I'm a busy guy.
I got stuff to do.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.716
How much did you lose
last night?

00:31:03.286 --> 00:31:05.284
What makes you think I lost?

00:31:05.286 --> 00:31:06.851
Well, it looked like you were

00:31:06.853 --> 00:31:09.790
drowning your sorrows,
not celebrating.

00:31:27.542 --> 00:31:30.243
Yours if you help me
get to Yamatai.

00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:32.647
And what will I spend it on,
a coffin?

00:31:33.982 --> 00:31:35.581
Then I'll go and get myself

00:31:35.583 --> 00:31:37.316
two rust buckets like this
with that.

00:31:37.318 --> 00:31:40.453
Even if you had a boat,
or two,

00:31:40.455 --> 00:31:42.457
you'd sink 'em before
you even left the harbor.

00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:46.760
What you need
is an experienced captain.

00:31:50.332 --> 00:31:52.434
So, what's in the other shoe?

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.910
<i>June 23rd.</i>

00:32:04.912 --> 00:32:07.879
<i>I may have found
the next piece to the puzzle.</i>

00:32:07.881 --> 00:32:10.616
<i>Ancient drawings hint
to the location of the tomb</i>

00:32:10.618 --> 00:32:13.820
<i>and an elaborate door
to keep her contained.</i>

00:32:13.822 --> 00:32:17.256
<i>I've found a way
to decipher the codes.</i>

00:32:17.258 --> 00:32:19.526
<i>I'm sure I can get to her.</i>

00:32:28.003 --> 00:32:30.468
<i>The ancient
Nihongi chronicles state</i>

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.372
<i>that within the tomb,</i>

00:32:32.374 --> 00:32:35.507
<i>one must face
the "Ordeals of Himiko."</i>

00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:38.776
<i>Cross the Chasm of Souls,</i>

00:32:38.778 --> 00:32:42.017
<i>pray to survive
the faces of Himiko,</i>

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:49.022
<i>behold her army
of a thousand handmaidens,</i>

00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:51.690
<i>descend upon
Himiko's final resting place,</i>

00:32:51.692 --> 00:32:53.962
<i>unleashing her scourge.</i>

00:33:04.973 --> 00:33:06.906
<i>July 6th. I'm convinced</i>

00:33:06.908 --> 00:33:08.775
<i>that my progress
is being monitored.</i>

00:33:09.344 --> 00:33:11.143
<i>I know them by name now...</i>

00:33:11.145 --> 00:33:12.878
<i>The Order of Trinity.</i>

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.948
<i>An ancient
militant organization</i>

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.815
<i>that seeks control
over the supernatural</i>

00:33:17.817 --> 00:33:20.119
<i>to rule the fate of mankind.</i>

00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:22.455
<i>What if Himiko is the weapon</i>

00:33:22.457 --> 00:33:24.659
<i>that Trinity has been seeking?</i>

00:33:34.435 --> 00:33:35.804
Can't sleep?

00:33:40.976 --> 00:33:42.411
It's beautiful.

00:33:45.247 --> 00:33:47.112
Enjoy it
while you can.

00:33:47.114 --> 00:33:48.982
We're headed into the most
dangerous stretch of water

00:33:48.984 --> 00:33:51.686
between Hong Kong
and California.

00:33:52.753 --> 00:33:55.457
Your dad sure knew
how to pick a holiday.

00:33:57.725 --> 00:34:01.862
Yeah. He had a knack for
the unexpected. Apparently.

00:34:05.865 --> 00:34:08.400
I am starting to wonder
if he'd gone mad, though.

00:34:10.238 --> 00:34:12.870
He didn't seem to know what
was real and what wasn't,

00:34:12.872 --> 00:34:17.477
obsessing over some
ancient Japanese death queen.

00:34:17.479 --> 00:34:20.080
Hey, some men
like dangerous women.

00:34:20.082 --> 00:34:22.915
Some men are foolish.

00:34:22.917 --> 00:34:24.550
What?

00:34:24.552 --> 00:34:28.089
Good night, Lu Ren.
Sweet dreams.

00:34:44.406 --> 00:34:46.339
Not William Tell yet,
but you're close.

00:34:46.341 --> 00:34:48.541
William Tell was a myth, Dad.

00:34:48.543 --> 00:34:51.413
Well, all myths
have foundation in reality.

00:34:52.613 --> 00:34:54.348
I have to head off, sprout.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.114
But you've only
just come back.

00:34:56.116 --> 00:34:58.652
- I'll be back before...
- I even know you're gone.

00:35:00.521 --> 00:35:02.355
Ana will keep an eye on you.

00:35:02.357 --> 00:35:04.689
I don't need one of
your employees babysitting me.

00:35:04.691 --> 00:35:06.795
I can take care of myself.

00:35:12.134 --> 00:35:13.568
My girl.

00:35:16.036 --> 00:35:17.205
Lara

00:35:22.178 --> 00:35:23.978
Never forget Dad loves you.

00:35:25.047 --> 00:35:26.182
I know.

00:36:12.459 --> 00:36:14.561
Thought that might wake you.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.998
Your island's found us.

00:36:21.902 --> 00:36:23.071
Yamatai.

00:36:35.749 --> 00:36:38.584
We've lost all control!

00:36:38.586 --> 00:36:40.785
- We need to abandon ship.
- What?

00:36:40.787 --> 00:36:42.521
We're dead
in the water.

00:36:42.523 --> 00:36:44.056
It's not gonna hold
much longer.

00:36:44.058 --> 00:36:45.338
We need to get off
this boat now.

00:37:01.343 --> 00:37:02.544
Wait!

00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:05.178
Dad's papers!

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.283
Forget them! Lara!

00:37:21.595 --> 00:37:22.830
Oh!

00:37:28.436 --> 00:37:30.139
Lara. Come on!

00:37:37.379 --> 00:37:38.613
Lu!

00:37:50.724 --> 00:37:52.328
The lifeboat!

00:38:16.749 --> 00:38:18.086
Watch out!

00:38:53.355 --> 00:38:54.423
Lu!

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.658
Lu!

00:40:13.733 --> 00:40:15.136
Where am I?

00:40:17.537 --> 00:40:20.439
Ah! She's awake.

00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:23.145
I was beginning
to get worried about you.

00:40:30.152 --> 00:40:31.186
A reef.

00:40:32.254 --> 00:40:34.018
You hit it.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.087
Thank God I found you.

00:40:36.089 --> 00:40:38.991
Most people who try to
come here die in the currents.

00:40:38.993 --> 00:40:41.695
Almost impossible to get here.

00:40:42.129 --> 00:40:44.132
Even harder to leave.

00:40:48.303 --> 00:40:49.404
Where's my...

00:40:55.876 --> 00:40:57.145
Right here.

00:41:03.883 --> 00:41:07.055
What are you doing here, Lara?

00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:13.058
I have two daughters.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.930
Dark hair like you.

00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:17.865
Pretty like you.

00:41:22.404 --> 00:41:26.105
Forgive me. Rude.

00:41:26.107 --> 00:41:27.805
I haven't hosted a guest
here in a very long time.

00:41:27.807 --> 00:41:30.477
My name is Mathias Vogel.

00:41:34.581 --> 00:41:36.250
You must be hungry.

00:41:40.588 --> 00:41:42.257
You know, I used to imagine

00:41:43.456 --> 00:41:45.524
that I might find an ear

00:41:45.526 --> 00:41:48.163
inside one of
those cans eventually.

00:41:49.896 --> 00:41:52.397
Isn't that mad?

00:41:52.399 --> 00:41:54.767
I guess being on this island
for so long

00:41:54.769 --> 00:41:57.568
can make you a little crazy.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:00.205
The only person
that I get to talk to

00:42:00.207 --> 00:42:02.942
is on the other end
of this phone.

00:42:02.944 --> 00:42:05.843
And they always say
the same thing...

00:42:05.845 --> 00:42:09.283
I can't go home until
my work on the island is done.

00:42:20.261 --> 00:42:22.261
What kind of work do you do?

00:42:22.263 --> 00:42:26.199
Oh, a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.

00:42:51.926 --> 00:42:53.593
You looking for this?

00:42:56.196 --> 00:42:59.367
The machinations of fate
never cease to amaze me.

00:43:01.201 --> 00:43:03.470
"The door to Himiko."

00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:07.674
Richard had the entrance.

00:43:11.044 --> 00:43:12.914
All that wasted time.

00:43:15.984 --> 00:43:17.548
You have brought me the thing

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.584
that I most wanted
in this world.

00:43:20.586 --> 00:43:21.621
Thank you.

00:43:24.724 --> 00:43:27.328
What do you know
about my father?

00:43:31.098 --> 00:43:32.998
Now I see the likeness.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.501
The intelligence in the face.

00:43:36.503 --> 00:43:38.406
The recklessness.

00:43:44.379 --> 00:43:46.443
All he had to do
was cooperate.

00:43:46.445 --> 00:43:49.448
Of course, being Richard,
he refused.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.920
Thought he was saving
the world.

00:43:52.187 --> 00:43:53.688
Where is he?

00:43:58.192 --> 00:43:59.926
Where is he?

00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:02.297
He's with God now.
I killed him.

00:44:06.767 --> 00:44:10.405
I'm sorry if I was too blunt.
I'm out of practice.

00:44:11.038 --> 00:44:13.175
It's been seven years.

00:44:14.575 --> 00:44:16.211
Seven years.

00:44:29.655 --> 00:44:31.156
Come on.

00:44:31.158 --> 00:44:32.525
Come on, come on!

00:44:33.726 --> 00:44:35.595
Come on. Get down there.

00:44:41.937 --> 00:44:43.671
Get those skids moving!

00:44:48.009 --> 00:44:49.441
Move.

00:44:49.443 --> 00:44:50.611
Move!

00:44:52.813 --> 00:44:54.514
Let's go!

00:44:54.915 --> 00:44:56.747
Pick it up!

00:44:56.749 --> 00:44:58.386
Come on, go!

00:45:01.588 --> 00:45:03.124
Tie her up!

00:45:14.902 --> 00:45:17.071
Okay, winch it up!

00:45:18.838 --> 00:45:20.307
Back to work.

00:45:21.742 --> 00:45:24.143
Lara Croft.

00:45:24.145 --> 00:45:26.613
You shouldn't have come here.

00:45:27.247 --> 00:45:29.250
But I'm glad that you did.

00:45:31.386 --> 00:45:34.922
Pack it up. We're moving camp!

00:45:37.458 --> 00:45:41.858
- All right, let's pack it up!
- Okay, move out!

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.630
We're moving camp!

00:45:50.804 --> 00:45:53.274
Keep it moving!
You, move!

00:45:54.308 --> 00:45:55.575
Move it, move it.

00:46:05.285 --> 00:46:07.419
Pick it up! Come on, let's go!

00:46:07.421 --> 00:46:09.922
Who are these people?

00:46:09.924 --> 00:46:13.393
Some are
shipwrecked fishermen.

00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:16.129
And some paid smugglers
to take 'em to a better life.

00:46:16.131 --> 00:46:18.232
Instead,
they brought 'em here.

00:46:19.334 --> 00:46:22.234
Come on!
We're backed up here. Move!

00:46:22.236 --> 00:46:24.472
He said he killed my dad.

00:46:27.706 --> 00:46:29.276
He killed mine.

00:46:30.277 --> 00:46:31.512
They saw it.

00:46:32.713 --> 00:46:35.183
Cold-blooded murder.

00:46:35.548 --> 00:46:36.851
I'm sorry.

00:46:39.154 --> 00:46:42.620
I'm sorry
that I brought you here.

00:46:42.622 --> 00:46:46.459
Well, you did take advantage
of a drunken sailor.

00:46:48.261 --> 00:46:50.295
Come on, move!

00:46:50.297 --> 00:46:52.599
At least we're not dead yet.

00:46:52.731 --> 00:46:54.201
No shit.

00:47:41.216 --> 00:47:43.285
I need
some CL 20 up here!

00:47:56.163 --> 00:47:57.463
Come on, let's go!

00:48:07.075 --> 00:48:09.441
You okay?

00:48:09.443 --> 00:48:11.009
Get him up and back to work
right now.

00:48:11.011 --> 00:48:12.811
Hang on.

00:48:12.813 --> 00:48:14.773
- Right now!
- Let him rest. We'll manage.

00:48:17.118 --> 00:48:18.615
Get him back
to work right now!

00:48:18.617 --> 00:48:21.020
He's sick, man.
He needs to rest.

00:49:17.443 --> 00:49:20.078
Get back to work!

00:49:28.922 --> 00:49:31.058
You heard him!
Let's get back to work!

00:49:38.933 --> 00:49:40.333
Hey, Lara.

00:49:40.335 --> 00:49:42.503
Lara! Get ready.

00:49:43.337 --> 00:49:44.538
Hey.

00:49:46.406 --> 00:49:47.738
Go!

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.775
Go!

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.463
Look out!

00:50:14.834 --> 00:50:16.570
Let's spread out!
Spread out!

00:50:33.953 --> 00:50:35.420
Get her!

00:50:35.422 --> 00:50:36.889
Get a move on!

00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:43.796
Grab her!

00:51:11.724 --> 00:51:15.127
She's in the river.
You want us to follow?

00:51:15.129 --> 00:51:16.695
No.

00:51:16.697 --> 00:51:18.931
I'm sending Rocket
to track her.

00:51:18.933 --> 00:51:22.569
If she survives,
he'll bring her back.

00:54:06.733 --> 00:54:07.969
Really?

00:58:23.722 --> 00:58:27.425
Easy now, easy.
I'm taking you back to camp.

00:58:53.085 --> 00:58:54.955
Stop struggling!

01:00:42.595 --> 01:00:43.596
Wait!

01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:57.241
No, no, no, no!

01:01:32.878 --> 01:01:35.445
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.

01:01:35.447 --> 01:01:37.683
Just ignore it. It'll go away.

01:02:06.445 --> 01:02:07.447
Dad?

01:02:10.082 --> 01:02:11.450
It's me.

01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:18.955
Dad?

01:02:18.957 --> 01:02:24.263
It's not real. Ignore it.
It'll go away. It always does.

01:02:24.265 --> 01:02:26.664
No, look at me, look at me.

01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:27.801
Please.

01:02:33.372 --> 01:02:35.474
Do you remember this?
Do you remember:

01:02:36.977 --> 01:02:38.379
We used to...

01:02:46.552 --> 01:02:47.854
It's me.

01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:54.760
It's Lara.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.869
Sprout.

01:03:07.606 --> 01:03:10.243
What the blazes
are you doing here?

01:03:17.183 --> 01:03:18.751
Dad, I'm hurt.

01:03:27.393 --> 01:03:28.760
It's all right.

01:03:50.749 --> 01:03:52.448
This will hurt me
more than it hurts you.

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:54.217
What?

01:03:54.219 --> 01:03:55.820
All right.

01:03:56.422 --> 01:03:58.891
You're all right.
You're all right.

01:04:00.192 --> 01:04:02.294
All right. It's all right.

01:04:03.163 --> 01:04:05.465
It's done.

01:04:17.843 --> 01:04:19.312
Rest now.

01:04:23.447 --> 01:04:25.351
Will you stay with me?

01:04:27.221 --> 01:04:28.956
I'm not going anywhere.

01:05:01.154 --> 01:05:04.391
Vogel! We found it! Yeah!

01:05:07.294 --> 01:05:11.530
Yeah! Come on! We found it!

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:20.270
I found it.

01:05:20.272 --> 01:05:22.007
Send the transport.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.613
I thought you'd gone.

01:06:03.615 --> 01:06:05.016
Usually when I see you
on this island,

01:06:05.018 --> 01:06:06.519
it's you who disappears.

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:31.843
Let me do that.

01:06:33.113 --> 01:06:34.447
Come here.

01:06:40.818 --> 01:06:43.755
So, sprout,
where did you end up?

01:06:44.523 --> 01:06:46.926
Did you go
to Oxford or Cambridge?

01:06:49.628 --> 01:06:51.695
Come on, which was it?

01:06:51.697 --> 01:06:53.532
You know what, Dad?

01:06:54.633 --> 01:06:57.668
I didn't go to university.

01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:01.371
Well, there's time yet.
You're still only a child.

01:07:01.373 --> 01:07:05.342
No, I was a child
when you left me.

01:07:05.344 --> 01:07:06.713
Ah, careful.

01:07:14.753 --> 01:07:17.720
Hardest day of my life

01:07:17.722 --> 01:07:20.425
when I gave up
trying to get back to you.

01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:27.432
But I realized
she'd never let me leave.

01:07:30.702 --> 01:07:34.375
What are you talking about?
Who's "she"?

01:07:34.773 --> 01:07:36.042
Himiko.

01:07:37.977 --> 01:07:41.179
Trinity had sent Vogel
to find her tomb

01:07:41.181 --> 01:07:43.646
so that he could wake her
and get her power.

01:07:43.648 --> 01:07:45.584
I had to stop them.

01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:49.586
Right.

01:07:49.588 --> 01:07:52.324
Vogel can't find the tomb
without me.

01:07:52.326 --> 01:07:54.892
And since I'm dead

01:07:54.894 --> 01:07:57.998
and since you've burnt
the rest of my research,

01:07:58.597 --> 01:08:00.466
he'll never find it.

01:08:02.236 --> 01:08:03.468
So...

01:08:05.138 --> 01:08:06.671
About that.

01:08:08.773 --> 01:08:10.740
What part of
"burn all my papers"

01:08:10.742 --> 01:08:12.876
did you not understand?

01:08:12.878 --> 01:08:16.414
If I'd burned the papers,
I wouldn't have found you.

01:08:16.416 --> 01:08:19.883
I set diversions and false
leads wherever I could.

01:08:19.885 --> 01:08:22.519
I watched for years
as they got it wrong.

01:08:22.521 --> 01:08:24.355
And now you lead them
by the hand.

01:08:24.357 --> 01:08:28.628
So a gun-toting psychopath
finds some ancient remains.

01:08:29.394 --> 01:08:31.161
So what?

01:08:31.163 --> 01:08:33.364
If Vogel opens that tomb,

01:08:33.366 --> 01:08:36.968
Himiko's curse will be
unleashed on the world.

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.635
Dad, listen...

01:08:38.637 --> 01:08:41.840
You coming here was a mistake.

01:08:47.646 --> 01:08:50.280
I came here to find out
what happened to you.

01:08:50.282 --> 01:08:52.118
So long as the tomb was safe,

01:08:52.617 --> 01:08:54.818
you were safe.

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.557
I was trying to keep you safe.

01:08:59.225 --> 01:09:00.991
But I underestimated your...

01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:02.129
My what?

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:06.665
- Stupidity?
- No.

01:09:10.403 --> 01:09:12.039
Your bravery.

01:09:18.077 --> 01:09:20.210
We have to get off
this island.

01:09:20.212 --> 01:09:21.877
There's no way off, Lara.

01:09:21.879 --> 01:09:23.814
Vogel's got a satellite phone.

01:09:23.816 --> 01:09:25.582
We can get to it.
We can call for help.

01:09:25.584 --> 01:09:27.317
Vogel has an army.

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:29.621
You were the one who taught me
to never give up.

01:09:32.925 --> 01:09:35.094
That was a different time.

01:09:36.595 --> 01:09:38.798
When I was a different man.

01:09:50.876 --> 01:09:53.745
- Lara.
- Well, I'm still his daughter.

01:09:55.181 --> 01:09:56.516
Lara!

01:10:19.504 --> 01:10:20.872
Come on!

01:10:43.829 --> 01:10:45.595
Try another combination.

01:10:45.597 --> 01:10:48.699
And another one,
and another one.

01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:00.244
Come on. Come on,
give me the damn code.

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:13.856
Hey. We're trying
the explosives again.

01:11:13.858 --> 01:11:15.392
Set another charge.

01:11:15.394 --> 01:11:16.796
Yes, boss.

01:11:39.184 --> 01:11:41.784
Get over there.
Stop talking.

01:11:55.167 --> 01:11:57.467
Get the guns.
I'm gonna get the sat phone.

01:11:57.469 --> 01:11:59.735
Then we'll find a way for all
of us to get out of here.

01:11:59.737 --> 01:12:01.338
We need to leave now.

01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:13.953
Vogel! They re escaping!

01:12:21.559 --> 01:12:23.095
Go!

01:12:23.495 --> 01:12:25.331
Shoot them!

01:12:41.613 --> 01:12:43.749
- Get them to safety.
- Okay.

01:12:48.086 --> 01:12:50.720
I'll be right behind you. Go.

01:13:39.171 --> 01:13:40.703
Shit.

01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:53.151
We have to move.

01:13:53.485 --> 01:13:54.818
I have to wait here.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.189
I'm not leaving Lara behind.

01:14:23.248 --> 01:14:25.385
It's beautiful,
isn't it, Richard?

01:14:28.687 --> 01:14:30.420
I wish I would've known
that you were alive

01:14:30.422 --> 01:14:32.224
all these years.

01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:35.894
At least I would've had
somebody to talk to.

01:14:48.772 --> 01:14:51.040
I need your help, Richard.

01:14:51.042 --> 01:14:53.443
Get the door open for me.

01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:55.678
It's been seven years.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.447
I'm going home
to see my family.

01:14:57.449 --> 01:15:00.287
If I open that tomb,
you won't have a family.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.922
Open it!

01:15:04.357 --> 01:15:05.523
Open it!

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:07.827
Open it!

01:15:08.594 --> 01:15:09.594
Never!

01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:14.663
Have it your way.

01:15:14.665 --> 01:15:17.836
With or without you,
I'm getting inside that tomb.

01:15:26.412 --> 01:15:27.446
Put that down!

01:15:29.948 --> 01:15:31.749
Put it down.

01:15:32.683 --> 01:15:34.383
You don't think
I can pull this trigger

01:15:34.385 --> 01:15:35.986
before you hit me
with that arrow.

01:15:35.988 --> 01:15:37.555
Shoot him, Lara. Shoot him!

01:15:38.123 --> 01:15:40.057
Come on, put your weapon down.

01:15:40.059 --> 01:15:42.329
Shoot him, Lara. We can't
let him get to Himiko.

01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:47.497
You really don't believe
this nonsense, do you?

01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:51.302
Tell your father to
open the door, or he's dead.

01:15:51.304 --> 01:15:53.671
You can make him do it, Lara.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.906
Transport's already
on its way.

01:15:56.908 --> 01:15:59.876
We can all be
off this goddamn island.

01:15:59.878 --> 01:16:01.578
Let him shoot me.

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:04.583
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.

01:16:07.053 --> 01:16:10.053
It's your decision.

01:16:10.055 --> 01:16:11.891
It's your finger
that's pulling this trigger.

01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.399
- I'm sorry.
- No.

01:16:22.534 --> 01:16:25.670
I haven't come all this way
to see you die.

01:16:31.844 --> 01:16:33.313
I'll do it.

01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:40.086
I'll open it.

01:16:44.888 --> 01:16:47.425
Finally, a Croft
with some sense.

01:18:23.722 --> 01:18:25.257
Ladies first.

01:18:52.218 --> 01:18:54.086
Mark the path.

01:19:26.218 --> 01:19:28.319
She's still breathing.

01:19:28.321 --> 01:19:30.954
Or it's a change in
atmospheric pressure.

01:19:30.956 --> 01:19:32.424
Keep walking.

01:19:49.108 --> 01:19:50.742
You should've seen
the look on your...

01:20:04.589 --> 01:20:07.127
That wasn't designed
to keep people out.

01:20:09.129 --> 01:20:11.160
That was put there
to keep people in.

01:20:11.162 --> 01:20:12.397
Dad?

01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:48.300
Chasm of Souls.

01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:45.824
You go next.

01:21:59.504 --> 01:22:03.608
"Pray to survive
the faces of Himiko."

01:22:04.108 --> 01:22:05.509
We're getting closer.

01:22:09.747 --> 01:22:14.250
"The Death Queen
turns day to night.

01:22:14.252 --> 01:22:17.455
"She must die
to bring back life."

01:22:23.062 --> 01:22:24.429
Oh, shit.

01:22:36.407 --> 01:22:37.675
- The floor!
- Lara!

01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:49.454
There's gotta be a way
to stop this.

01:22:50.956 --> 01:22:52.456
Look around!

01:22:54.393 --> 01:22:56.592
Come on. Come on!

01:22:56.594 --> 01:22:58.797
Vogel, what's going on?

01:23:12.912 --> 01:23:14.277
"Pray to survive."

01:23:14.279 --> 01:23:17.082
It's a keyhole. We need a key!

01:23:18.283 --> 01:23:19.750
The prayer wheels!

01:23:24.689 --> 01:23:25.723
Lara!

01:23:30.395 --> 01:23:31.761
It's not working.

01:23:31.763 --> 01:23:33.432
Check the other prayer wheels.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.467
Try this!

01:23:39.803 --> 01:23:41.139
No.

01:23:41.306 --> 01:23:42.540
Wait.

01:23:46.045 --> 01:23:47.046
It's a color puzzle.

01:23:50.049 --> 01:23:53.316
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."

01:23:53.318 --> 01:23:55.753
- Black.
- Black! Here!

01:23:57.422 --> 01:23:58.488
Shit!

01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:59.724
Blue!

01:24:01.326 --> 01:24:02.458
No!

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:03.729
Here!

01:24:05.096 --> 01:24:06.497
It doesn't work.

01:24:08.134 --> 01:24:09.135
Lara!

01:24:16.341 --> 01:24:18.610
Last one! Yellow!

01:24:25.549 --> 01:24:27.317
It's not working.

01:24:27.319 --> 01:24:29.519
Just try them all, damn it!

01:24:29.521 --> 01:24:32.454
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."

01:24:32.456 --> 01:24:34.290
"She must die
to bring back..."

01:24:34.292 --> 01:24:35.557
"Life."

01:24:35.559 --> 01:24:36.929
Come on!

01:24:38.729 --> 01:24:40.598
The color of life.

01:24:46.437 --> 01:24:48.107
I'm running out of floor!

01:24:55.281 --> 01:24:56.615
Green!

01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:22.437
You always were the brains
of the family, sprout.

01:25:26.245 --> 01:25:28.546
Well, let's get going, sprout.

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.922
Where's the floor?

01:25:37.055 --> 01:25:38.056
Gone.

01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:53.472
Flare.

01:26:09.653 --> 01:26:11.522
Come on, Lara.

01:26:13.892 --> 01:26:15.127
I'm going back for her.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.328
I'm coming with you.

01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:20.166
You dad gave his life for us.

01:26:58.069 --> 01:27:03.308
Himiko's army of
a thousand handmaidens.

01:27:04.242 --> 01:27:07.575
They sacrificed themselves
in ritual suicide

01:27:07.577 --> 01:27:09.880
to serve their queen
in the afterlife.

01:27:15.753 --> 01:27:17.889
Exactly as your notes.

01:27:20.425 --> 01:27:21.626
We found her.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.223
All right, this is it.
We're finishing this.

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:54.958
It's not too late
to change your mind.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.592
There's a very big difference

01:27:56.594 --> 01:27:58.860
between myth and reality,
Richard.

01:27:58.862 --> 01:28:01.833
Something that you could
never understand.

01:28:02.732 --> 01:28:03.935
Gentlemen.

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.655
Open it.

01:29:07.965 --> 01:29:11.601
You see? I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.

01:29:11.603 --> 01:29:13.435
It's just...

01:29:13.437 --> 01:29:15.241
...a little old lady.

01:29:18.143 --> 01:29:20.011
Prepare her for transport.

01:29:28.585 --> 01:29:30.422
Something doesn't add up.

01:29:31.455 --> 01:29:34.826
She's not a monster
in any of these paintings.

01:29:40.398 --> 01:29:43.434
It looks like she was
taking herself here.

01:29:47.238 --> 01:29:48.872
Not being forced.

01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:54.443
<i>The Death Queen
turns day to night.</i>

01:29:54.445 --> 01:29:56.846
<i>She must die
to bring back life.</i>

01:29:56.848 --> 01:29:58.417
"Bring back life."

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.785
<i>Spreading
death and destruction</i>

01:30:03.787 --> 01:30:05.027
<i>with just the touch
of her hand.</i>

01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:07.992
Go on.

01:30:10.461 --> 01:30:12.461
All myths have
foundation in reality.

01:30:12.463 --> 01:30:14.164
...in reality.

01:30:14.166 --> 01:30:16.235
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.

01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:18.970
Wait!

01:30:20.871 --> 01:30:23.474
She was sacrificing herself.

01:30:25.776 --> 01:30:27.913
She was protecting the world.

01:30:43.095 --> 01:30:44.627
See?

01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:46.364
Smoke and mirrors.

01:30:48.732 --> 01:30:50.834
All right, let's bag her up.
Come on.

01:31:10.956 --> 01:31:12.925
They thought it was magic.

01:31:19.130 --> 01:31:21.065
She was a carrier.

01:31:22.566 --> 01:31:23.867
She was immune.

01:31:31.343 --> 01:31:32.844
It's a disease.

01:32:25.495 --> 01:32:28.831
This is what Trinity wants.
This gets me home.

01:32:28.833 --> 01:32:33.138
If you take this out
into the world, it's genocide.

01:32:39.176 --> 01:32:43.181
I just need to take
a very small piece of you.

01:33:38.602 --> 01:33:40.973
Go! Get her! Get her!

01:34:01.558 --> 01:34:03.927
Well, this is it, Richard.

01:34:03.929 --> 01:34:06.195
All we have to do
is walk out of here.

01:34:06.197 --> 01:34:07.598
You're not going anywhere.

01:34:19.543 --> 01:34:21.246
Come on, Richard.

01:34:23.813 --> 01:34:25.349
Think of your daughter.

01:34:34.024 --> 01:34:35.459
Come on.

01:34:36.727 --> 01:34:38.063
Come on.

01:36:31.943 --> 01:36:34.011
- Dad.
- Lara.

01:36:34.245 --> 01:36:36.012
Vogel's gone.

01:36:36.014 --> 01:36:38.981
- You need to go after him.
- Come on, let's go.

01:36:38.983 --> 01:36:41.752
- No, stay back. Stay back.
- What are you talking...

01:36:44.687 --> 01:36:46.190
I'm done for.

01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:53.464
I'm infected.

01:36:55.866 --> 01:36:57.136
No.

01:37:00.404 --> 01:37:03.574
You can't touch me.
Don't touch.

01:37:04.607 --> 01:37:08.110
You must stop Vogel
and get the hell out of here.

01:37:08.112 --> 01:37:10.514
And I'll bury Himiko
once and for all.

01:37:12.183 --> 01:37:13.847
I've only just found you.

01:37:13.849 --> 01:37:16.352
Promise me you'll stop him.
Promise me!

01:37:16.354 --> 01:37:17.987
There must be another way.

01:37:17.989 --> 01:37:19.721
Lara.

01:37:19.723 --> 01:37:22.493
You're a very, very
bright young woman.

01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:25.463
There's no other way.

01:37:32.938 --> 01:37:35.172
I need you.

01:37:35.174 --> 01:37:38.776
No, you don't.
You're worth 10 of me.

01:37:41.179 --> 01:37:43.378
You said you don't
believe in magic.

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.916
Well, what's this, my darling?

01:37:46.283 --> 01:37:48.550
All this time here...

01:37:48.552 --> 01:37:51.286
I wished I could
see you grow up.

01:37:51.288 --> 01:37:52.886
No.

01:37:52.888 --> 01:37:54.557
And now I have.

01:37:54.959 --> 01:37:56.860
It's a miracle.

01:37:57.261 --> 01:37:59.361
Chin up, sprout.

01:37:59.363 --> 01:38:01.200
There's jobs to do.

01:38:03.733 --> 01:38:05.269
Go on, go!

01:38:06.536 --> 01:38:08.802
There's no time, Lara.

01:38:08.804 --> 01:38:09.807
Go on, go!

01:38:25.455 --> 01:38:27.225
Dad loves you.

01:38:31.428 --> 01:38:32.997
I love you.

01:39:27.785 --> 01:39:30.119
Oh, you really wanna
do this, little girl?

01:39:30.121 --> 01:39:31.656
Let's just go home.

01:39:45.403 --> 01:39:48.036
You're not savin' anyone.

01:39:48.038 --> 01:39:49.371
Trinity is everywhere.

01:39:52.277 --> 01:39:53.477
Yeah?

01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:34.617
I made a promise.

01:40:39.090 --> 01:40:41.855
No. No. No!

01:40:41.857 --> 01:40:43.893
You're not
getting out of here.

01:40:44.162 --> 01:40:45.663
No! No!

01:41:45.687 --> 01:41:47.057
When you see Richard,

01:41:48.393 --> 01:41:50.194
send him my regards.

01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:32.836
Send them yourself.

01:42:50.121 --> 01:42:52.622
You messed
with the wrong family.

01:44:51.175 --> 01:44:52.709
Lara!

01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:00.385
Lara!

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.691
Lara?

01:45:52.403 --> 01:45:54.038
Well...

01:45:54.437 --> 01:45:55.940
We're not dead yet.

01:46:00.344 --> 01:46:02.013
No shit.

01:46:26.635 --> 01:46:30.708
Vogel, Vogel, this is
Patna Transport Bravo 5. Over.

01:46:33.811 --> 01:46:36.413
Vogel, Vogel,
are you reading me? Over.

01:46:37.714 --> 01:46:38.950
Boss.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.988
You're takin' us home, yeah?

01:47:23.626 --> 01:47:26.694
Officially gone. Like magic.

01:47:26.696 --> 01:47:28.695
I don't think he has gone.

01:47:30.433 --> 01:47:33.537
- I see so much of him in you.
- Thanks, Ana.

01:47:33.736 --> 01:47:35.405
Really.

01:47:36.073 --> 01:47:38.308
You're in charge now, Lara.

01:47:39.911 --> 01:47:42.810
This is a list
of all our assets.

01:47:42.812 --> 01:47:44.678
Thank you.

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.847
No, I think you'd better stay

01:47:46.849 --> 01:47:48.650
on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.

01:47:48.652 --> 01:47:51.052
Well, as you wish.

01:47:51.054 --> 01:47:53.054
Boardrooms and business deals.

01:47:53.056 --> 01:47:55.556
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.

01:48:02.764 --> 01:48:06.370
Neither was Dad,
as it turns out.

01:48:21.085 --> 01:48:23.953
Are all these companies
owned by us?

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:25.355
Yes.

01:49:06.562 --> 01:49:08.796
<i>I know them
by name now...</i>

01:49:08.798 --> 01:49:11.035
<i>The Order of Trinity.</i>

01:49:12.970 --> 01:49:14.802
<i>An ancient
militant organization</i>

01:49:14.804 --> 01:49:17.306
<i>that seeks control
over the supernatural</i>

01:49:17.308 --> 01:49:20.178
<i>in order to rule
the fate of mankind.</i>

01:49:23.647 --> 01:49:26.815
<i>What kind of work
do you do?</i>

01:49:26.817 --> 01:49:31.219
<i>Oh, a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.</i>

01:49:31.221 --> 01:49:33.992
<i>Are all these companies
owned by us?</i>

01:49:36.292 --> 01:49:38.394
<i>You're not
savin' anyone.</i>

01:49:39.028 --> 01:49:42.164
<i>Trinity is everywhere.</i>

01:49:42.166 --> 01:49:44.199
<i>I know it's difficult
to accept.</i>

01:49:44.201 --> 01:49:47.238
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.

01:49:48.171 --> 01:49:50.137
<i>I think
you'd better stay</i>

01:49:50.139 --> 01:49:51.708
<i>on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.</i>

01:49:52.041 --> 01:49:53.909
<i>As you wish.</i>

01:49:53.911 --> 01:49:56.012
<i>The only person
that I get to talk to</i>

01:49:56.014 --> 01:49:58.416
<i>is on the other end
of this phone.</i>

01:50:08.392 --> 01:50:10.325
<i>You must understand.</i>

01:50:10.327 --> 01:50:13.164
<i>We Crofts,
we have responsibilities.</i>

01:50:15.631 --> 01:50:17.100
Jobs to do.

01:50:26.977 --> 01:50:29.478
Oh. You again.

01:50:32.116 --> 01:50:34.048
I came back for the amulet.

01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:36.384
Shame. I was hoping
you'd forgotten.

01:50:36.386 --> 01:50:38.186
It's worth a bloody fortune.

01:50:38.188 --> 01:50:40.488
I did tell you
it was your lucky day.

01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:41.822
Yes, you did.

01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:46.364
- At it again, are we, Alan?
- I'm not at it.

01:50:53.237 --> 01:50:55.435
I don't know
if you've noticed or not,

01:50:55.437 --> 01:50:57.271
but, uh, you can't be
too careful these days

01:50:57.273 --> 01:50:59.408
because the world
has gone bloody mad.

01:50:59.410 --> 01:51:01.874
Yes, yes, thank you, Alan.

01:51:01.876 --> 01:51:06.280
What you got there is
a HK USP 9 mil. extended mag.

01:51:06.282 --> 01:51:08.218
It's my personal favorite.

01:51:11.154 --> 01:51:12.954
You like that?

01:51:12.956 --> 01:51:14.056
I do.

01:51:14.058 --> 01:51:15.259
Mmm.

01:51:17.161 --> 01:51:18.729
I'll take two.
