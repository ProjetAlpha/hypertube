WEBVTT

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.676
Do you know what time it is?

00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:14.905
Can't sleep.

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.066
There are tabs for that.

00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:50.566
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:51.953
Dreams again.

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:57.940
Want to fight?

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:03.479
- I slipped.
- Right. You slipped.

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:05.940
As a result of me punching
you in the face.

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:08.096
I was already slipping when you
happened to punch me in the face.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.526
But you most probably did.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:11.807
Tell me about this dream.

00:03:13.648 --> 00:03:14.648
Anything new?

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
No.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.190
You have to let go of the past.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:23.315
Can't remember my past.

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.495
It's causing you doubt. And
doubt makes you vulnerable.

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:36.212
Control it.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.051
Learn to control again. You'll have to
commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.450
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:49.848
Humor is a distraction.

00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:55.033
Anger... anger
represents the enemy.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.921
120 days since the
last Skrull attack.

00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:13.046
Has anyone ever seen what the Supreme
Intelligence really looks like?

00:04:13.274 --> 00:04:16.959
No one can look upon the Supreme
Intelligence in its true form.

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:19.181
You know that.

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:24.765
Our subconcious chooses the way
they appear to us, so it's sacred.

00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:26.293
It's personal.

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:28.550
No Kree divulges it. Ever.

00:04:28.804 --> 00:04:29.804
Who do you see?

00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:31.797
- Your brother.
- No.

00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:33.023
- Father.
- No.

00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:35.164
- Your old commander.
- Vers.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.109
It's me you see, isn't it?

00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.656
I see what you're trying to do.

00:04:39.898 --> 00:04:41.483
- Is it working?
- Yes.

00:04:41.554 --> 00:04:43.397
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:47.038
What is the point of giving me these
if you don't want me to use them?

00:04:47.202 --> 00:04:48.858
I want you to use them.

00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:53.116
The Supreme Intelligence gave me
responsibility of showing you how to use them.

00:04:53.162 --> 00:04:54.162
I know how.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.693
Well if that were true, you could've
knocked me down without it.

00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:00.021
Control your impulses.

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:04.021
Stop using this, and
start using this.

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:06.005
I want you...

00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:08.435
to be the best
version of yourself.

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:14.659
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE
HEAD OF CIVILIZATION KREE

00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:50.562
Vers.

00:05:51.758 --> 00:05:52.851
Intelligence.

00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:56.359
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

00:05:56.516 --> 00:05:57.624
I am.

00:05:58.117 --> 00:06:01.109
You struggle with your emotions.

00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:04.156
With your past, what fuels them.

00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:09.038
You are just one victim of the
Skrull expansion that has

00:06:09.063 --> 00:06:11.648
threatened our civilization for centuries.

00:06:12.008 --> 00:06:17.085
Imposters who silently infiltrate,
then take over our planets.

00:06:19.264 --> 00:06:23.662
Horrors that you remember,
and so much that you do not.

00:06:27.276 --> 00:06:29.323
It's all blank...

00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:30.713
My life.

00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:33.995
You're supposed to take the
form of who I used to admire,

00:06:34.003 --> 00:06:38.713
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:40.768
Perhaps, this is a mercy.

00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:42.987
Sparing you from a deeper pain.

00:06:43.876 --> 00:06:47.001
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must.

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:50.301
Put your people's needs
before your own.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.267
We've given you a great gift.

00:06:52.494 --> 00:06:55.650
The chance to fight for
the good of all Kree.

00:06:56.752 --> 00:06:58.040
I want to serve.

00:06:58.056 --> 00:06:59.970
Then master yourself.

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:03.149
What was given can
be taken away.

00:07:07.303 --> 00:07:08.357
I won't let you down.

00:07:08.382 --> 00:07:10.470
We'll know soon enough.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.181
You have a mission.

00:07:14.022 --> 00:07:16.439
Serve well and with honor.

00:07:37.288 --> 00:07:38.827
This can't be good.

00:07:38.983 --> 00:07:41.053
Must be another Skrull attack.

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.842
Whatever it is, it's big.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:45.873
- Has a Skrull ever simmed you?
- Once.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.045
- It was deeeply disturbing.
- Why?

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.640
Because I stared into the
face of my mortal enemy

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.608
and then they stared
back with my own.

00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:55.632
Maybe if you were more attractive,
then it would be less disturbing.

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.748
You think you're funny.
I'm not laughing.

00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:01.640
- You never laugh.
- I laugh. On the inside.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.390
I'm not doing it now.

00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:05.828
It's funny, 'cause objectively
speaking, you're quite handsome.

00:08:05.843 --> 00:08:06.843
Well, thank you.

00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:09.194
Listen up, team. Knock it off.

00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:10.898
Right.

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:13.874
Prepare for...

00:08:14.554 --> 00:08:17.514
A search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr.

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:20.413
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

00:08:20.429 --> 00:08:22.288
This time, Torfa.

00:08:22.413 --> 00:08:25.374
Soh-Larr sent us a warning signal.
It was intercepted,

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:26.984
and his cover's blown.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:32.468
The Skrull general Talos has
sent kill units to find him.

00:08:32.516 --> 00:08:33.957
Should they reach
him before we do,

00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:37.708
the intelligence he's acquired over
three years is as good as theirs.

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:41.880
The Accusers will bomb a Skrull
stronghold here in the south.

00:08:41.905 --> 00:08:46.514
We slip in, we locate
Soh-Larr, and we get out.

00:08:46.763 --> 00:08:48.805
Leaving them none the wiser.

00:08:48.852 --> 00:08:52.125
The Torfan populace, we are
not to interfere with them,

00:08:52.141 --> 00:08:57.102
nor them with us. Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

00:08:57.172 --> 00:08:59.078
Proceed with caution.

00:08:59.188 --> 00:09:01.562
Follow protocol before
extracting hiim.

00:09:03.282 --> 00:09:04.977
This is a dangerous mission.

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:07.422
We must all be ready to
join the Collective...

00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:09.242
if that is our fate today.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.259
- For the good of all Kree.
- For the good of all Kree!

00:09:27.723 --> 00:09:30.059
TORFA KREE BORDER PLANET
P137.T55412AS.C00876

00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:24.194
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

00:10:24.296 --> 00:10:26.631
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation.

00:10:45.903 --> 00:10:47.864
Locals on the periphery.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.051
- Maybe a dozen.
- Minn-Erva?

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:55.634
Do you read me? Anybody copy?

00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:12.803
His beacon's coming from that temple.
Let's move.

00:11:12.828 --> 00:11:15.490
No. This is a perfect
spot for an ambush.

00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:18.584
- Only one way in and one way out.
- We can get past the locals.

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:20.982
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

00:11:21.007 --> 00:11:22.764
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

00:11:22.789 --> 00:11:24.256
No, you won't.

00:11:28.724 --> 00:11:30.809
Right. We keep a close radius.

00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:33.325
We lose comms, we
meet back in here.

00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:35.021
Come on.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.435
- Att-Lass, you getting this?
- Copy. I see them.

00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:16.114
Minn-Erva, do you
have eyes on us?

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:21.271
- Keep them back. Minn-Erva?
- Does anybody copy?

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.724
I don't wanna hurt you.

00:12:29.468 --> 00:12:31.249
Keep back!

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:35.750
Stand back!

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:43.680
They're locals. I found two dead. No green.
They're just starving.

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:13.203
- HGX-78.
- 2RT-79. 8XX.

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:17.744
Get back.

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:27.711
Skrulls!

00:13:45.255 --> 00:13:46.255
Vers!

00:13:47.137 --> 00:13:50.589
Vers... it's an ambush...

00:14:08.828 --> 00:14:10.180
Incoming!

00:14:15.794 --> 00:14:18.981
Talk to me. Do you copy?

00:14:22.177 --> 00:14:24.645
How did you know the code?

00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:27.231
How about I tell you my secret...

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:31.083
...when you tell me yours.

00:14:34.745 --> 00:14:36.331
Let's open her up.

00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:51.508
- Where are we?
- Standby.

00:14:54.044 --> 00:14:55.646
Where's your head at?

00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:58.481
In the clouds. Where's yours?

00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:00.129
On my shoulders.

00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:02.832
About to show these boys how we do it.
You ready?

00:15:03.473 --> 00:15:05.942
- Higher, further, faster, baby.
- That's right.

00:15:14.988 --> 00:15:16.629
This can't be right.

00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:20.667
Go back even further.

00:15:24.154 --> 00:15:27.318
You're too fast! You
need to go slow!

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.720
Now who is this person?
Are--- are we in the right...

00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:45.191
What the hell are you thinking?
You don't belong out here!

00:15:45.216 --> 00:15:46.903
I think we went back too far.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:47.996
You won't let me drive.

00:15:48.005 --> 00:15:49.504
Let me try it back.

00:15:57.466 --> 00:15:59.356
What the hell is wrong with her?

00:15:59.493 --> 00:16:01.466
You'll kill yourself.

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.466
They'll never let you fly.

00:16:08.498 --> 00:16:10.981
I am not the only one
who's confused here.

00:16:11.006 --> 00:16:14.568
You're a decent pilot, but
you're too emotional.

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.513
You do know why they call
it a "cockpit", don't you?

00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:27.443
...Huge rubble,
throughout the cosmos...

00:16:27.468 --> 00:16:30.475
...shift the moon and the sun
and the stars in the sky.

00:16:31.226 --> 00:16:34.655
And soon, they'll wile away.
Flew out throughout the night.

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:37.007
Did you see it?

00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:43.077
Get your butts inside, it's time to eat.
Prepare for take-off, Lt. Trouble.

00:16:43.087 --> 00:16:44.259
Charming memory.

00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:46.923
Hang on. I think I got it.

00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:52.919
Goose likes you.

00:16:53.067 --> 00:16:54.958
She doesn't typically
take to people.

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:57.582
- Early start to your morning?
- Late night, actually.

00:16:57.598 --> 00:17:00.465
I can't sleep when there's work to do.
Sound familiar?

00:17:00.544 --> 00:17:03.144
Flying airplanes never
feels like work.

00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:07.089
- Wonderful view, isn't it?
- I prefer the view from up there.

00:17:07.114 --> 00:17:08.559
You'll get there
soon enough, ace.

00:17:08.613 --> 00:17:10.279
Wait, wait, wait, that's her.

00:17:10.334 --> 00:17:12.146
- Get her back.
- Standby.

00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:17.492
...sound familiar...

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:19.609
Wonderful view, isn't it?

00:17:21.477 --> 00:17:24.187
- i prefer the view from up there.
- You'll get there soon enough...

00:17:24.212 --> 00:17:26.899
What's that on her shirt?
I couldn't read it.

00:17:28.563 --> 00:17:30.602
Wonderful view, isn't it?

00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:35.472
- I prefer the view from up there.
- You'll get there soon enough...

00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:39.019
Focus... Look down.

00:17:39.402 --> 00:17:40.800
Focus.

00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:44.559
Pegasus... Dr. Wendy Lawson.
That's her.

00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:46.975
- Do you hear that, too?
- Now track the location.

00:17:48.953 --> 00:17:49.953
Got it.

00:17:50.031 --> 00:17:53.498
Now track Lawson until we
find the energy signature.

00:17:57.363 --> 00:17:58.964
Interesting.

00:18:01.394 --> 00:18:02.581
Hold on...

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:05.369
- Go back right before this.
- Okay.

00:18:09.224 --> 00:18:11.286
Now let's see where
you're headed.

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:15.895
That's right. Look at the
coordinates... Focus.

00:18:19.322 --> 00:18:22.072
That's it. That's it.
Almost there...

00:18:22.095 --> 00:18:23.822
You're almost there. Don't fight it.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.571
Focus! Focus!

00:18:28.153 --> 00:18:30.896
Get her back! Get her back now.

00:18:51.323 --> 00:18:55.440
Do we have any information
we can act on?

00:18:55.471 --> 00:18:58.619
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

00:18:58.656 --> 00:18:59.789
We're on our way.

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:02.494
Then dig, dig, dig, deeper.

00:19:02.697 --> 00:19:05.361
Lawson is our link to
that lightspeed engine.

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:09.150
And everything we're after.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:21.116
That did something.
Try that again?

00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:33.832
Not yet!

00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:44.791
What did you do to me?

00:19:45.002 --> 00:19:46.931
We're just after little information.

00:19:46.956 --> 00:19:50.362
- What did you put in my head?
- Nothing that wasn't already there.

00:19:52.076 --> 00:19:53.654
But those aren't my memories.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.013
Yeah, it's like a
bad trip in there.

00:19:56.271 --> 00:19:58.591
I'm not surprised you
can't keep it straight.

00:19:58.603 --> 00:20:00.529
They really did a number on you.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.673
Enough of your mindgames.
What do you want?

00:20:05.842 --> 00:20:09.576
We're looking for the location of a Dr.
Lawson and her lightspeed engine.

00:20:09.636 --> 00:20:11.917
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:14.737
Then why is she in your head?

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.451
Either of you wouldn't happen to know
how these things come off, would you?

00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:51.397
No? Fine.

00:22:23.332 --> 00:22:24.332
Hey.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:30.732
You do know why
they call it co...

00:22:48.845 --> 00:22:51.073
Leaving so soon?

00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:52.979
We just got to know each other.

00:23:42.278 --> 00:23:44.411
PLANET C-53 : TERRAIN HOMEWORLD
C053.FR45887+125X47

00:24:15.994 --> 00:24:18.728
Vers to Starforce Command.
Do you read me?

00:24:21.181 --> 00:24:22.181
Hello?

00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:23.587
Do you copy?

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:55.144
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

00:24:55.169 --> 00:24:56.981
Is this C-53?

00:24:58.899 --> 00:25:01.680
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

00:25:01.696 --> 00:25:04.156
Yeah. I understand you.

00:25:04.181 --> 00:25:07.071
Good. Are you in charge of
security for this district?

00:25:08.923 --> 00:25:12.282
Sort of.... The movie
theater has its own gate.

00:25:12.986 --> 00:25:15.899
Where can I find
communication equipment?

00:25:22.296 --> 00:25:23.296
Thank you.

00:25:56.336 --> 00:25:58.851
Track the pod and find the girl.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.671
She knows more than she knows.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.180
Hey!

00:26:06.534 --> 00:26:08.369
This one's taken.

00:26:18.538 --> 00:26:19.975
Come on...

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.946
Vers...

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:26.626
- Clarify: CQC-39.
- GRX8-1600.

00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:28.813
And I'm fine, thank
you for asking.

00:26:29.025 --> 00:26:32.220
- Is everyone okay? What happened?
- Skrull ambush.

00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:34.321
I thought we'd lost you.

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:36.642
- Did you find Soh-Larr?
- It wasn't Soh-Larr.

00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:39.056
Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.

00:26:39.392 --> 00:26:41.243
That's impossible.

00:26:41.303 --> 00:26:43.474
That code was buried
in his subconscious.

00:26:43.499 --> 00:26:45.631
The Skrulls messed with my mind.
The machine that they used,

00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:48.131
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:51.092
- Vers, where are you?
- I'm on Planet C-53.

00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:54.177
The Skrulls are looking
for someone named Lawson.

00:26:54.202 --> 00:26:55.202
Who?

00:26:55.772 --> 00:26:58.474
She's who I see...

00:26:58.982 --> 00:27:00.263
She's what?

00:27:01.428 --> 00:27:02.428
Vers.

00:27:03.717 --> 00:27:05.295
Vers, what?

00:27:06.077 --> 00:27:07.576
She's a scientist.

00:27:07.601 --> 00:27:09.624
They think that she's cracked
the code on lightspeed tech.

00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:12.702
I have to get to her before they do or
else they'll be able to invade galaxies.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.476
No. You've been
caught once already.

00:27:15.922 --> 00:27:17.882
How far is C-53?

00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:20.405
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

00:27:20.867 --> 00:27:23.077
Vers, hold your position
until we get there.

00:27:23.102 --> 00:27:25.008
Keep your comms online
so we can contact...

00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:27.039
No. What if they get
a hold of it before...

00:27:31.093 --> 00:27:32.093
Vers.

00:27:32.987 --> 00:27:33.987
Vers.

00:27:35.768 --> 00:27:36.768
Vers!

00:27:38.088 --> 00:27:40.588
If the Skrulls capture
her, she's compromised.

00:27:40.611 --> 00:27:42.611
She's stronger than you think.

00:27:43.721 --> 00:27:45.752
Ever been to C-53?

00:27:46.182 --> 00:27:47.182
Once.

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:50.181
It's a real shithole.

00:28:10.312 --> 00:28:12.038
You called this in?

00:28:26.328 --> 00:28:28.187


00:28:31.172 --> 00:28:32.305
Excuse me, Miss.

00:28:32.875 --> 00:28:35.351
Did you know anything
about a lady blowing a hole

00:28:35.367 --> 00:28:38.004
through the roof of that
blockbuster over there?

00:28:38.224 --> 00:28:41.028
Witness says she looks
dressed for laser tag.

00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:46.141
Yeah, I think she went that way.

00:28:46.673 --> 00:28:49.587
Uhh, I'd like to ask
you some questions.

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:53.891
Maybe give you the 411 on
the late-night drive-bys.

00:28:54.672 --> 00:28:56.266
Can I see some
identification, please?

00:28:56.298 --> 00:29:00.641
Vers. Kree Starforce. We don't carry
our identification on little cards.

00:29:00.829 --> 00:29:01.938
Vers!

00:29:02.298 --> 00:29:04.087
Starforce.

00:29:05.465 --> 00:29:06.955
How long do you
plan to be in town?

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:09.064
Oh, I'll be out of your
hair, soon as I track down

00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:11.182
the Skrulls that are
infiltrating your planet.

00:29:12.495 --> 00:29:13.807
Skrulls?

00:29:14.323 --> 00:29:18.221
Shapeshifters? They can transform
into any lifeform down to their DNA?

00:29:19.745 --> 00:29:21.815
Oh, boy. You guys don't
have any clue, do you?

00:29:21.831 --> 00:29:23.807
Whoa, whoa ,whoa. Hold up.

00:29:24.865 --> 00:29:26.865
How do we know...

00:29:26.904 --> 00:29:30.091
you're not one of
those shapeshifters?

00:29:30.154 --> 00:29:34.130
Congratulations, Agent Fury. You're
finally asking the right question.

00:29:34.186 --> 00:29:37.052
No. Congratulations to
you, Starforce lady!

00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:39.178
You're under arrest.

00:29:47.044 --> 00:29:48.231
Let's roll!

00:29:49.225 --> 00:29:50.818
Rook! Let's roll!

00:30:00.023 --> 00:30:02.429
- Did you see her weapon?
- I did not.

00:30:46.247 --> 00:30:48.995
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

00:31:09.684 --> 00:31:12.293
"Trust me, true believer.
Trust me..."

00:31:17.429 --> 00:31:19.522
"Trust me, true believer..."

00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:04.883
Train's headed to
a tunnel up ahead.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.296
Let's greet them at the station.

00:33:20.479 --> 00:33:23.096
Agent Fury, this is Agent Coulson.
Umm..

00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:26.900
Uh, I'm still here at the
Blockbuster, and uh...

00:33:27.946 --> 00:33:32.453
Where'd everybody go? I
finished collecting evidence...

00:35:07.167 --> 00:35:10.816
Official SHIELD activity.
Stay back.

00:35:43.597 --> 00:35:44.432
PANCHO'S BAR

00:35:58.911 --> 00:36:01.302
Nice scuba suit.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.822
Lighten up, honey, huh?
Gonna smile for me?

00:36:34.282 --> 00:36:38.086
All life on Earth is carbon-based.
Not this guy.

00:36:38.477 --> 00:36:42.469
Whatever he runs on, it's not
on the periodic table.

00:36:42.568 --> 00:36:45.453
So you're saying he's
not from around here?

00:36:46.341 --> 00:36:47.911
Hey, how's your eye?

00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:50.473
Well, I'd say fine.

00:36:50.825 --> 00:36:53.387
But it can't believe
what it's seeing.

00:36:55.415 --> 00:36:57.391
You said...

00:36:58.061 --> 00:37:00.649
this thing looked like Coulson?

00:37:00.674 --> 00:37:02.633
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

00:37:02.892 --> 00:37:05.008
And the woman said
that there were more?

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.665
The word she used
was infiltration.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.512
- You believe her?
- Not till I saw this.

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.881
What's your plan?

00:37:14.615 --> 00:37:16.412
I'll find the Blockbuster girl.

00:37:16.437 --> 00:37:20.447
I got word of a motorcycle thief
that fits her description.

00:37:20.622 --> 00:37:23.348
If she can tell us why
these lizards are here...

00:37:23.427 --> 00:37:25.850
Maybe she can tell us how
to kick 'em to the curb.

00:37:25.874 --> 00:37:26.897
Good.

00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:31.616
Do it alone, though. You
can't trust anyone.

00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:35.006
- Not even our own men.
- Yes, sir.

00:37:49.307 --> 00:37:52.010
Wow. They are big
bastards, aren't they?

00:37:53.659 --> 00:37:55.752
Yeah, well. He's
no Brad Pitt, sir.

00:38:00.838 --> 00:38:03.792
Safe journey to the beyond, my friend.

00:38:05.137 --> 00:38:08.101
I will finish what we started.

00:38:16.764 --> 00:38:18.973
I wouldn't get too
close there, boss.

00:38:20.989 --> 00:38:22.706
No one in or out.

00:39:24.997 --> 00:39:28.012
- What can I get you?
- Where was this photograph taken?

00:39:28.544 --> 00:39:31.262
- Airport?
- Where's Pegasus?

00:39:31.294 --> 00:39:36.528
That's classified. Not unlike
the file I've started on you.

00:39:38.647 --> 00:39:41.248
I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

00:39:41.264 --> 00:39:42.842
Grunge is a good look for you.

00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:45.639
- Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury?
- It's cool.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.164
You know, had a space
invasion, big car chase...

00:39:49.189 --> 00:39:52.813
Got to watch an alien autopsy...

00:39:52.862 --> 00:39:55.641
- Typical 9 to 5.
- So you saw one.

00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:58.815
I was never one to
believe in aliens..

00:39:59.619 --> 00:40:01.548
...but I can't unsee that.

00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:04.395
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask...

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.997
You think I'm one of
those green things.

00:40:07.022 --> 00:40:08.224
Can't be too careful.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.052
You, are looking at 100%
red-blooded Earthman.

00:40:13.099 --> 00:40:14.933
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:18.560
- We talking cheek swab or urine sample?
- No. The DNA would match.

00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:19.595
Want my AOL password?

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.092
Skrulls can only sim recent
memories of their hosts' bodies.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.130
You wanna get personal.

00:40:27.394 --> 00:40:29.037
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

00:40:29.062 --> 00:40:30.769
But technically I don't
remember that part.

00:40:30.794 --> 00:40:32.390
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snookers.

00:40:32.415 --> 00:40:34.679
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said. Do I pass?

00:40:34.704 --> 00:40:37.744
- Not yet. First job?
- Soldier. Straight outta high school.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.228
Left with a rank of full colonel.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.502
- Then?
- Spy.

00:40:40.527 --> 00:40:42.715
- Where?
- It's the Cold War. We were everywhere.

00:40:42.846 --> 00:40:45.673
Belfast, Bucharest,
Belgrade, Budapest.

00:40:45.689 --> 00:40:47.376
I like the B's. I
can make 'em rhyme.

00:40:47.423 --> 00:40:48.001
Now?

00:40:48.025 --> 00:40:49.853
Been riding a desk for the
past six years trying to

00:40:49.878 --> 00:40:52.140
figure out where our future
enemies are coming from.

00:40:52.165 --> 00:40:54.978
Never occured to me they
would be coming from above.

00:40:55.869 --> 00:40:59.337
Name a detail so bizarre, a
Skrull can never fabricate it.

00:41:01.009 --> 00:41:03.446
If a toast is cut
diagonally, I can't eat it.

00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:08.185
You didn't need that, did you?

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:10.280
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

00:41:10.326 --> 00:41:13.654
Okay. Your turn. Prove
you're not a Skrull.

00:41:21.952 --> 00:41:26.146
And how is that suppposed to
prove to me you're not a Skrull?

00:41:26.663 --> 00:41:28.435
That's a photon blast.

00:41:28.459 --> 00:41:30.889
- And?
- A Skrull can't do that.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.865
So, a full-bred colonel turned
spy turned SHIELD Agent.

00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:36.177
Must have pretty high
security clearance.

00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:38.341
Where's Pegasus?

00:41:43.695 --> 00:41:48.484
Okay. The Skrulls sim alien races to
infiltrate and take over planets...

00:41:48.515 --> 00:41:50.398
and you're a Kree.

00:41:50.414 --> 00:41:53.507
- A race of noble warriors.
- Heroes.

00:41:53.523 --> 00:41:55.226
Noble warrior heroes.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.890
So, what do Skrulls want with Dr.
Lawson?

00:42:00.259 --> 00:42:03.962
They believe that she developed
a lightspeed engine at Pegasus.

00:42:03.978 --> 00:42:06.407
Lightspeed engine?

00:42:06.634 --> 00:42:09.399
Gotta admit, that's not the
craziest thing I've heard today.

00:42:09.423 --> 00:42:11.126
Well, it's still early.

00:42:11.189 --> 00:42:13.391
And you? What do you want?

00:42:13.415 --> 00:42:16.157
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

00:42:16.197 --> 00:42:17.338
And?

00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:24.004
Look, war is a universal language.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.028
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

00:42:27.615 --> 00:42:30.419
You got a personal
stake in this.

00:42:40.093 --> 00:42:43.088
This is government property.
Turn your vehicle around.

00:42:43.664 --> 00:42:46.937
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of SHIELD.

00:42:46.984 --> 00:42:48.999
Place your thumb on the pad.

00:42:50.023 --> 00:42:51.320
One moment.

00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:55.523
Nicholas Joseph Fury?
You have three names?

00:42:56.077 --> 00:42:57.853
Everybody calls me Fury.

00:42:57.878 --> 00:43:01.245
Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick.
Just Fury.

00:43:01.284 --> 00:43:03.010
- What does your Mom call you?
- Fury.

00:43:03.034 --> 00:43:04.682
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

00:43:04.698 --> 00:43:06.885
- What about your kids?
- If I had them...

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.518
- they'll call me Fury.
- You're cleared for access.

00:43:09.543 --> 00:43:10.543
Thank you.

00:43:40.289 --> 00:43:41.726
Oh, hold up.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.046
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

00:43:47.225 --> 00:43:48.437
Put that on.

00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:51.452
- What is it?
- It's the SHIELD logo.

00:43:51.477 --> 00:43:55.682
Does announcing your identity on clothing
help with the covert part of your job?

00:43:55.738 --> 00:43:58.580
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.

00:43:59.495 --> 00:44:00.948
Lose the flannel.

00:44:11.402 --> 00:44:12.823
How can I help you?

00:44:13.598 --> 00:44:16.472
We're Agents of SHIELD.

00:44:17.994 --> 00:44:20.033
We're looking for a
woman named Lawson.

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:22.267
Dr. Wendy Lawson.

00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:25.379
Do you know her?

00:44:29.645 --> 00:44:30.738
Follow me.

00:44:35.168 --> 00:44:38.504
You familiar with the
phrase 'welcome wagon'?

00:44:39.692 --> 00:44:40.692
No.

00:44:41.717 --> 00:44:43.560
Well this ain't it.

00:44:51.564 --> 00:44:53.852
- Is that a communicator?
- Yeah.

00:44:53.877 --> 00:44:55.944
State-of-the-art two-way pager.

00:44:56.103 --> 00:44:59.094
- Who are you paging?
- My Mom. Don't worry.

00:44:59.126 --> 00:45:00.907
I didn't mention you.

00:45:01.788 --> 00:45:05.258
DETAINED WITH TARGET. NEED BACKUP

00:45:14.736 --> 00:45:16.036
ARCHIVES

00:45:39.694 --> 00:45:40.817
After you.

00:45:40.842 --> 00:45:42.272
Impressive.

00:45:42.296 --> 00:45:45.363
You should see what I can
do with a paperclip.

00:45:55.761 --> 00:45:58.878
Hey, how are you, huh?

00:46:00.746 --> 00:46:03.175
Look at you. Just look at you!

00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:05.532
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

00:46:05.551 --> 00:46:07.943
Aren't you cute?
What's your name, huh?

00:46:08.013 --> 00:46:09.814
What's your name? "Goose".

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:11.956
Cool name for a cool cat.

00:46:11.972 --> 00:46:13.237
Fury?

00:46:16.042 --> 00:46:17.893
I'll be back.

00:46:20.987 --> 00:46:24.557
Hold! Lemme get my fingerprint out.
Just let me unravel this...

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.462
You sat there, and watched me play with
tape, when all you had to do was...

00:46:32.492 --> 00:46:34.892
I didn't want to
steal your thunder.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.110
Lawson.

00:47:03.675 --> 00:47:06.341
Lawson's plan for the
lightspeed engine.

00:47:07.593 --> 00:47:09.979
I wonder why they
terminated the project.

00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:15.436
Maybe because she's.... coo-coo.

00:47:17.032 --> 00:47:19.360
- Kree glyphs?
- Huh?

00:47:20.973 --> 00:47:23.426
Lawson is not coo-coo.

00:47:24.906 --> 00:47:26.180
She's Kree.

00:47:27.049 --> 00:47:30.640
- Well... she's dead.
- What?

00:47:31.153 --> 00:47:34.840
She crashed an Aces aircraft during
an unauthorized test flight.

00:47:34.865 --> 00:47:36.910
Took a pilot down with her.

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:39.293
That's why security
here's so friendly.

00:47:39.358 --> 00:47:42.123
They're covering up a
billion-dollar mistake.

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.458
Oh. And your lightspeed engine?
It's toast.

00:47:50.339 --> 00:47:54.799
- When did this crash happen?
- Six years ago. 1989.

00:47:56.742 --> 00:47:58.726
Who was the pilot?

00:47:59.211 --> 00:48:02.124
Most of this thing's
redacted, but...

00:48:02.149 --> 00:48:08.984
there is a testimonial here from a Maria
Rambeau. Last person to see them alive.

00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:20.923
Bag it.

00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:52.836
This isn't about fighting wars.

00:48:53.347 --> 00:48:55.347
It's about ending them.

00:49:01.017 --> 00:49:02.681
I know Lawson was Kree.

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:05.565
She was here on C-53 and
died in a plane crash.

00:49:05.744 --> 00:49:08.204
Do you know anything about this?

00:49:08.416 --> 00:49:11.416
I just discovered a mission
report sent from C-53.

00:49:11.509 --> 00:49:14.680
There's only so much I'm
cleared to tell you, Vers.

00:49:14.712 --> 00:49:15.993
But...

00:49:19.298 --> 00:49:23.282
Lawson, was an undercover Kree
operative named Mar-Vell.

00:49:23.399 --> 00:49:26.953
She was working on a
unique energy core...

00:49:27.079 --> 00:49:30.235
Experimenting with tech that apparently,

00:49:30.241 --> 00:49:32.592
could help us win the war.

00:49:38.566 --> 00:49:39.539
She still here?

00:49:39.564 --> 00:49:42.480
She's cooperating with
the investigation, sir.

00:49:42.636 --> 00:49:44.433
- You men, stay here.
- Yes, sir.

00:49:44.449 --> 00:49:47.183
I want to question her alone.

00:49:48.024 --> 00:49:50.578
Excellent work, Nicholas.

00:49:53.594 --> 00:49:55.594
Does it say anything about me?

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.883
Anything about you?
No, of course, not.

00:49:57.907 --> 00:49:59.053
Why would it?

00:49:59.078 --> 00:50:02.406
I found evidence that I...
had a life here.

00:50:02.431 --> 00:50:03.507
On C-53?

00:50:06.578 --> 00:50:10.828
Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the
Supreme Intelligence. I knew her.

00:50:11.016 --> 00:50:12.788
And I knew her as Lawson.

00:50:12.929 --> 00:50:14.601
This sounds like Skrull
simulation, Vers.

00:50:14.633 --> 00:50:16.742
No, it's not because I remember.
I was here...

00:50:16.767 --> 00:50:18.820
Stop. Remember your training.

00:50:18.845 --> 00:50:21.251
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

00:50:21.275 --> 00:50:24.829
Do not let your emotions
override your judgement.

00:50:26.124 --> 00:50:28.904
She's on sub-level 6.
I'll get off on 5, hit

00:50:28.929 --> 00:50:31.616
the stairs in case she
makes a run for it.

00:50:32.667 --> 00:50:35.831
Do a pincer move. Like
we did in Havana.

00:50:35.885 --> 00:50:39.807
Right. Like we did in Havana.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:52.868
We're nearing the jump point. Leave
your beacon on so I can find you.

00:50:53.024 --> 00:50:55.430
We'll get to the
bottom of this, Vers.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:56.774
Together.

00:50:59.927 --> 00:51:00.927
Okay.

00:51:18.824 --> 00:51:19.824
Vers!

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.160
Vers!

00:51:40.404 --> 00:51:42.225
Fury's colluding with the target.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.592
Then why would he call us in?

00:51:43.616 --> 00:51:45.653
All I know is we take him in, too.
Dead or alive.

00:51:45.678 --> 00:51:47.412
Dead or alive?

00:52:02.447 --> 00:52:03.447
Go! Go, go!

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:18.026
Was it something I said?

00:52:56.477 --> 00:53:00.836
Now, you know, I don't
really need these to see.

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:02.211
But...

00:53:02.524 --> 00:53:05.360
They do kinda complete the look.

00:53:05.886 --> 00:53:07.429
Don't you think?

00:53:24.799 --> 00:53:27.277
- You called it in?
- My bad!

00:53:41.195 --> 00:53:45.046
- Coulson! You have eyes on them?
- They're not down here.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.382
Let's try up there.

00:53:56.365 --> 00:53:57.100
What?

00:53:57.124 --> 00:54:00.170
Your communicator. You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

00:54:30.862 --> 00:54:32.331
Do you know how to
fly this thing?

00:54:32.356 --> 00:54:33.643
Uhh, we'll see.

00:54:33.675 --> 00:54:35.831
That's a 'yes or no' question.

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:40.590
Yes.

00:54:44.059 --> 00:54:46.059
That's what I'm talking about.

00:55:12.812 --> 00:55:14.671
We got a stowaway.

00:55:18.125 --> 00:55:19.507
Hang on, Goose.

00:55:24.994 --> 00:55:26.040
Goose.

00:55:31.057 --> 00:55:33.940
Who's a good kitty, huh? Huh, Goose?

00:55:34.877 --> 00:55:38.241
Yes, that's right. Who's
a good kitty, Goose?

00:55:38.266 --> 00:55:41.610
- You the good kitty.
- See anyone you know?

00:55:43.008 --> 00:55:44.336
Funny story...

00:55:44.625 --> 00:55:48.312
I arrived on Hala,
near dead, no memory...

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:50.648
That was six years ago.

00:55:50.664 --> 00:55:54.125
So you think, you're the pilot
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

00:55:54.133 --> 00:55:57.664
I'm saying the last person to see
them alive will probably tell us.

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.883
- Maria Rambeau.
- So how do we get to Louisiana?

00:56:02.055 --> 00:56:04.968
Due east. Hang a
right on Memphis.

00:56:06.235 --> 00:56:07.711
That agent...

00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:10.349
That stopped the Skrulls
from finding us...

00:56:10.374 --> 00:56:11.977
Coulson. The new guy.

00:56:12.317 --> 00:56:15.911
- I guess he doesn't hate me yet.
- Yeah, well. Give him time.

00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:19.059
I guess he had a
feeling, you know.

00:56:19.113 --> 00:56:21.519
Went with his gut against orders.

00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:25.370
It's a really hard thing to do.
That's what keeps us human.

00:56:25.395 --> 00:56:27.577
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

00:56:27.602 --> 00:56:29.999
I see that about you.

00:56:30.436 --> 00:56:33.771
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.663
I'm guessing that's not standard
Kree operating procedure.

00:56:37.679 --> 00:56:40.499
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

00:56:48.117 --> 00:56:49.050
Ronan.

00:56:49.075 --> 00:56:51.239
The Accusers completed
their operation, but the

00:56:51.264 --> 00:56:53.561
greater mission was a failure
thanks to your team.

00:56:53.583 --> 00:56:55.067
It was a trap.

00:56:55.192 --> 00:56:57.973
To lure our operative Vers
to talk for her kidnapper.

00:56:57.989 --> 00:57:00.762
Give us the location. We'll take
care of the terrorist threat.

00:57:00.801 --> 00:57:05.082
By bombing them out of the galaxy.
No.

00:57:05.357 --> 00:57:08.224
- We'll handle this.
- Son of Skrulls anywhere...

00:57:08.249 --> 00:57:11.577
is a threat to Kree everywhere.
Where are they?

00:57:11.593 --> 00:57:13.116
- They are...
- Lost.

00:57:14.636 --> 00:57:17.007
They are lost, for now.

00:57:17.179 --> 00:57:18.765
But we will find them.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.154
Do so.

00:57:20.905 --> 00:57:22.826
Or we will.

00:57:26.526 --> 00:57:28.870
Maintain the course for C-53.

00:57:47.832 --> 00:57:50.267
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Maria Rambeau?

00:57:52.488 --> 00:57:53.988
Auntie Carol?

00:57:54.012 --> 00:57:56.355
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

00:57:57.045 --> 00:57:59.566
I knew it! Everyone
said you were dead.

00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:02.099
But we knew they were lying.

00:58:03.953 --> 00:58:06.369
I'm not really who
you think I am.

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:19.167
- That is the craziest shit I ever heard.
- Green, transforming aliens?

00:58:19.191 --> 00:58:22.109
- There's no such thing.
- You're absolutely right, young lady.

00:58:22.134 --> 00:58:24.980
There is  no such thing.
'Cause if there were...

00:58:25.011 --> 00:58:27.839
We would wanna keep
that to ourselves.

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.870
You don't believe me?

00:58:36.876 --> 00:58:39.656
No way. That's so cool.

00:58:40.208 --> 00:58:43.391
She can do a lot more than
make tea with those hands.

00:58:43.415 --> 00:58:46.531
- Like what? Show us.
- Maybe later.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.893
I kept all your stuff.
I'll go get it.

00:58:50.968 --> 00:58:53.436
You wanna give her
a hand with that?

00:59:08.766 --> 00:59:10.917
You don't remember anything?

00:59:12.079 --> 00:59:13.344
I can see...

00:59:14.344 --> 00:59:15.789
...flashes...

00:59:16.742 --> 00:59:18.289
Little moments.

00:59:19.321 --> 00:59:21.226
But I can't tell what's real.

00:59:22.896 --> 00:59:25.906
If I can just piece together
what happened that morning...

00:59:26.667 --> 00:59:29.185
Maybe it'll make sense.

00:59:31.779 --> 00:59:35.628
You woke me up, banging
on my door at dawn.

00:59:35.653 --> 00:59:37.465
Your usual move.

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.310
Back then we had to
get up so early.

00:59:40.871 --> 00:59:44.011
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat, so...

00:59:44.036 --> 00:59:47.503
testing Lawson's plane was our only
shot at doing something that mattered.

00:59:47.528 --> 00:59:50.457
And you wanted a race at the
base, in your old Mustang,

00:59:50.473 --> 00:59:53.285
and I wouldn't want to argue, 'cause
I knew my Camaro would dominate.

00:59:53.302 --> 00:59:55.668
But you cheated.
Took a shortcut.

00:59:55.684 --> 00:59:57.011
Since when is a
shortcut cheating?

00:59:57.036 --> 00:59:59.504
Since it violates the predetermined
rules of engagement.

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:02.941
- I definitely don't remember those.
- Of course, you don't.

01:00:07.544 --> 01:00:09.349
When I got to the hangar...

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:12.677
Lawson was agitated.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.513
She said she had lives to save.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:19.435
She was trying to take the
Aces up herself, but you said...

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.712
"If there were lives at stake...

01:00:22.267 --> 01:00:24.087
I would fly the plane."

01:00:24.807 --> 01:00:27.939
Yup. Big hero moment.

01:00:28.302 --> 01:00:30.880
The kind of moment we've
both been waiting for.

01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:34.207
The Doc was always unique.

01:00:34.544 --> 01:00:36.450
Felt like it, but.

01:00:37.036 --> 01:00:38.737
Now you're saying she's...

01:00:38.956 --> 01:00:41.088
from another planet.

01:00:41.776 --> 01:00:45.245
- I know this must be hard for you.
- What, this part right here?

01:00:46.675 --> 01:00:47.675
No.

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.050
No. Mmm-mm.

01:00:51.808 --> 01:00:53.362
Know what's hard?

01:00:53.594 --> 01:00:55.596
It is losing my best friend

01:00:56.074 --> 01:00:59.925
in a mission so secret, they
act like it never even happened.

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:02.725
Hard...

01:01:03.762 --> 01:01:07.394
is knowing you were out there
somewhere, too damn stubborn to die.

01:01:08.771 --> 01:01:11.581
And now you come up in
here after 6 years...

01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:15.426
With your super-charged fire-hands
and you expect me to call you...

01:01:15.582 --> 01:01:17.699
I don't even know what... "Vers"?

01:01:19.334 --> 01:01:21.099
Is that really who you are now?

01:01:23.532 --> 01:01:25.008
I don't know.

01:01:30.244 --> 01:01:31.713
Come look.

01:01:38.318 --> 01:01:39.919
This is me and you on Halloween.

01:01:40.198 --> 01:01:43.143
I'm Amelia Earhart, and
you're Janis Joplin.

01:01:43.206 --> 01:01:45.224
This is you when you were little.

01:01:45.249 --> 01:01:49.147
You didn't get along with your parents,
so Mom said we became your real family.

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.890
This is us on Christmas.

01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:51.915
I got more...

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.124
Here's another picture of
you when you were little.

01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:55.930
And this is how you
actually graduated...

01:02:05.153 --> 01:02:08.036
Oh, wait. I forgot, your jacket.

01:02:08.465 --> 01:02:12.019
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore
after i spilled ketchup on it.

01:02:24.732 --> 01:02:27.232
That was all that
survived the crash.

01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:30.192
Or so we thought.

01:02:34.655 --> 01:02:36.045
Don't answer that.

01:02:36.783 --> 01:02:38.592
It's just my neighbor.

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:40.537
They can change into anyone.

01:02:45.663 --> 01:02:46.795
Hi, there.

01:02:47.343 --> 01:02:48.632
What do you want?

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:53.211
Hey, Tom. This is
my friend, Carol.

01:02:53.305 --> 01:02:54.805
Pleased to meet you!

01:02:56.254 --> 01:02:57.254
Yow!

01:02:57.645 --> 01:03:00.323
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

01:03:00.348 --> 01:03:02.949
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road,

01:03:02.981 --> 01:03:04.981
and I was just wondering
if you'd mind if I

01:03:05.006 --> 01:03:07.395
bring the boys over to
get a closer looksie?

01:03:07.535 --> 01:03:09.144
- A closer looksie?
- Yeah.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:12.730
To see the bird parked
out by the road.

01:03:14.308 --> 01:03:17.285
You're really working overtime
to sell this one, aren't you...

01:03:17.316 --> 01:03:18.503
Talos?

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.823
I'm sorry, Tom. This
isn't a good time.

01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:25.439
I'll come by tomorrow? Okay?

01:03:27.822 --> 01:03:31.064
You know, you really should
be kinder to your neighbors.

01:03:31.379 --> 01:03:34.157
You never know when you're gonna
need to borrow some sugar.

01:03:37.937 --> 01:03:39.312
Hang on a second.

01:03:39.702 --> 01:03:43.296
Before you go swinging
those jazz-hands around,

01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:46.289
making a mess in
your friend's house,

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:49.929
- and... it's a lovely home.
- Oh, my God...

01:03:50.046 --> 01:03:51.382
What the hell?!

01:03:55.363 --> 01:03:59.880
No one's gonna hurt the girl.
Just, don't kill me.

01:03:59.905 --> 01:04:02.008
It can really complicate
the situation.

01:04:02.033 --> 01:04:06.374
I'm about 5 seconds from complicating that
wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

01:04:06.399 --> 01:04:11.102
I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now
I stand before you as my true self.

01:04:11.687 --> 01:04:14.452
- Without deception.
- And who's that out there?

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:17.138
Okay. That's a fair point.

01:04:17.163 --> 01:04:19.170
But I'm sure that
you understand,

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:21.327
I had to take some precautions.

01:04:21.343 --> 01:04:24.725
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

01:04:24.763 --> 01:04:27.335
with your hands bound.
I just wanna talk.

01:04:27.359 --> 01:04:29.710
The last time we talked, I ended
up hanging from my ankles.

01:04:29.749 --> 01:04:32.397
That was before I
knew who you were.

01:04:32.444 --> 01:04:35.600
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

01:04:36.562 --> 01:04:39.068
I have an audio
recording from Pegasus,

01:04:39.093 --> 01:04:43.194
with your voice, from a
plane crash, six years ago.

01:04:43.234 --> 01:04:47.764
On a device I believe
you call a "black box".

01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:52.178
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.
How'd you get it?

01:04:52.214 --> 01:04:55.331
Does she not understand? Young lady
I have a special skill that kinda

01:04:55.355 --> 01:04:58.636
allows me to get into places
I'm not supposed to be in.

01:04:58.738 --> 01:05:02.769
Call me young lady again, and I'm gonna put
my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.

01:05:04.304 --> 01:05:06.882
Am I supposed to
guess, where that is?

01:05:07.217 --> 01:05:08.530
- Your ass.
- Your ass.

01:05:08.617 --> 01:05:11.171
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

01:05:11.195 --> 01:05:14.850
But look, I just need your help
decoding some coordinates.

01:05:14.921 --> 01:05:17.147
If you sit down, you
listen to this,

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.468
I assure you, it'll
be worth your while.

01:05:22.695 --> 01:05:25.054
Call your buddy back
inside and I'll listen.

01:05:25.664 --> 01:05:26.664
Deal.

01:05:27.476 --> 01:05:28.601
Oh, my God!

01:05:28.617 --> 01:05:31.366
Get that thing away!
How'd that get in here?

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.484
The cat? This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:39.737
That's not a cat.
That's a Flerken.

01:05:39.808 --> 01:05:42.659
- A Flerken?
- Mom?

01:05:50.216 --> 01:05:52.973
- Monica...
- Why can't I listen too?

01:06:20.406 --> 01:06:21.914
What's happening?

01:06:21.939 --> 01:06:23.289
It's loading.

01:06:27.133 --> 01:06:32.837
Punch in the coordinates:
5239, -47, 8.768, 0.2.

01:06:32.862 --> 01:06:35.213
Copy that. Where
are we going, Doc?

01:06:35.321 --> 01:06:38.102
- My laboratory.
- Your laboratory?

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.571
- What do you mean?
- Oh, no.

01:06:40.587 --> 01:06:44.235
Is that... Wait, what is that?
It's not showing up on my radar.

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.033
Go, Carol. Fly!

01:06:46.073 --> 01:06:47.073
That's no () Lawson.

01:06:47.674 --> 01:06:49.533
- Who the hell are they?
- Those are the bad guys.

01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:51.768
- Fly faster, now.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:59.845
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:02.029
I never should have
brought you along.

01:07:07.099 --> 01:07:08.795
Here comes some G's.

01:07:27.095 --> 01:07:29.329
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

01:07:40.094 --> 01:07:42.710
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

01:07:45.453 --> 01:07:47.843
Stay with me, Lawson!

01:08:05.221 --> 01:08:06.822
Danvers, do you copy?

01:08:06.847 --> 01:08:09.175
Yeah, I copy. On the ground.

01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:13.284
- Can anyone hear me?
- Yeah. I copy.

01:08:15.657 --> 01:08:16.657
Doc?

01:08:17.782 --> 01:08:18.860
Your blood...

01:08:20.352 --> 01:08:21.696
it's blue.

01:08:21.821 --> 01:08:23.243
Never mind that.

01:08:23.579 --> 01:08:25.516
How's my hair?

01:08:26.579 --> 01:08:28.360
Help me out, will you?

01:08:31.978 --> 01:08:36.087
- I have to destroy it before they get here.
- What... Lawson?

01:08:36.635 --> 01:08:40.783
You remember what I said about
my work here? What it's for?

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.525
- To end wars?
- Yeah.

01:08:43.721 --> 01:08:46.642
But the wars are
bigger than you know.

01:08:47.198 --> 01:08:48.517
Damn it!

01:08:49.629 --> 01:08:52.363
My name is not Lawson.

01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:55.144
My real name, is Mar-Vell...

01:08:55.184 --> 01:08:58.339
and I come from a
planet called Hala.

01:08:59.504 --> 01:09:01.754
I'd say you were
delusional, but...

01:09:01.777 --> 01:09:04.925
we just got shot down by a
spaceship, and your blood is blue.

01:09:05.702 --> 01:09:08.933
Listen. I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:12.827
Now skedaddle before you
give me any more regrets.

01:09:12.858 --> 01:09:15.202
Just remember the
coordinates, okay?

01:09:15.288 --> 01:09:17.491
You got to save them without me.

01:09:17.507 --> 01:09:18.694
Save who? How?

01:09:18.718 --> 01:09:21.334
No, I got to blow this
engine before they find it.

01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:22.827
What are you doing?

01:09:42.954 --> 01:09:45.287
We have no interest
in hurting you.

01:09:45.619 --> 01:09:46.619
No?!

01:09:46.688 --> 01:09:49.720
Because all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:53.055
The energy core...

01:09:53.165 --> 01:09:54.492
Where is it?

01:09:54.532 --> 01:09:57.094
Pararescue's on the way.

01:09:57.258 --> 01:09:59.711
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

01:09:59.727 --> 01:10:02.078
Then I see no reason to
prolong this conversation.

01:10:02.094 --> 01:10:03.195
No, wait!

01:10:09.842 --> 01:10:11.967
You mean that energy core?

01:11:00.394 --> 01:11:02.894
Commander. She's still moving.

01:11:03.074 --> 01:11:05.331
- Permission to fire.
- Hold your fire.

01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:18.758
There's nothing left. The
core has been destroyed.

01:11:21.951 --> 01:11:23.068
"VERS"

01:11:28.177 --> 01:11:30.614
She absorbed its' power.

01:11:32.443 --> 01:11:34.177
She's coming with us.

01:11:55.175 --> 01:11:56.583
He lied to me.

01:11:58.918 --> 01:12:02.183
- Everything that I knew was a lie.
- Now...

01:12:02.496 --> 01:12:04.909
- ...you understand.
- What?

01:12:05.097 --> 01:12:06.651
What do I understand now?

01:12:06.675 --> 01:12:09.948
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.
He killed her.

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:13.659
Because she found out that
she was on the wrong side

01:12:13.825 --> 01:12:15.980
of an unjust war.

01:12:16.005 --> 01:12:19.630
No. Your people
are terrorists...

01:12:19.638 --> 01:12:22.559
that kill innocents. I
saw the ruins on Torfa.

01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:26.122
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

01:12:26.732 --> 01:12:30.593
My people lived as
refugees, on Torfa.

01:12:30.789 --> 01:12:33.772
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule,

01:12:33.797 --> 01:12:36.148
and they destroyed our planet.

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:39.523
Now the handful of
us that are left,

01:12:39.883 --> 01:12:41.898
will be slaughtered next.

01:12:41.922 --> 01:12:46.289
Unless, you will help me
finish what Mar-Vell started.

01:12:47.422 --> 01:12:49.540
The coordinates you
found, would've powered

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:53.752
a lightspeed ship capable of
carrying us to safety. A new home.

01:12:54.177 --> 01:12:56.619
Where the Kree can't reach us.

01:12:57.771 --> 01:13:01.817
Lawson always told us that her work
at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars...

01:13:01.896 --> 01:13:03.411
But to end them.

01:13:03.575 --> 01:13:08.895
She wanted you to help
us find the core.

01:13:09.891 --> 01:13:11.328
Well, I already destroyed it.

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:15.868
No, you destroyed the engine. The core
that powers it is on a remote location.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:19.821
If you help us decode
those coordinates...

01:13:20.267 --> 01:13:21.970
We can find it.

01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:26.116
You'll use it to destroy us.

01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:30.828
We just want a home.

01:13:34.946 --> 01:13:40.187
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

01:13:40.204 --> 01:13:42.164
Can't you see it now?

01:13:42.196 --> 01:13:44.711
You're not one of them.

01:13:46.558 --> 01:13:48.414
You don't know me.

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:52.167
You have no idea who I am.

01:13:54.277 --> 01:13:56.417
I don't even know who I am.

01:13:57.941 --> 01:14:00.542
You are Carol Danvers.

01:14:01.274 --> 01:14:04.750
You are the woman on that
black box risking her life

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:06.625
to do the right thing.

01:14:07.962 --> 01:14:09.673
My best friend...

01:14:09.852 --> 01:14:11.930
who supported me as a mother,

01:14:11.955 --> 01:14:14.318
and a pilot when
no one else did.

01:14:14.846 --> 01:14:19.643
You're smart, and funny, and
a huge pain in the ass.

01:14:20.183 --> 01:14:23.542
And you are the most
powerful person I know.

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:26.464
Way before you can shoot
fire from your fist.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.628
Do you hear me?

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:31.924
Do you hear me?

01:14:47.237 --> 01:14:51.104
I know I don't deserve
your trust, but...

01:14:51.104 --> 01:14:53.049
you're our only lead.

01:14:53.143 --> 01:14:55.408
We discovered that
your energy signature

01:14:55.456 --> 01:14:58.385
matched Mar-Vell's core.

01:14:59.222 --> 01:15:00.831
Now, we know why.

01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:07.183
If only you knew, the
importance of it to me.

01:15:07.792 --> 01:15:09.479
I just need your help.

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:13.339
Decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:17.137
Those weren't coordinates.
They're safe vectors.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.214
Orbital positioning and philosophy.

01:15:19.252 --> 01:15:22.417
You didn't find her lab on Earth,
because it's not on Earth.

01:15:22.463 --> 01:15:25.025
That was the location on the day
of the crash six years ago.

01:15:25.041 --> 01:15:28.517
If we track its course, we'll
find it, in orbit, right now.

01:15:28.533 --> 01:15:31.009
It's just basic physics.

01:15:33.072 --> 01:15:34.525
In our orbit?

01:15:35.525 --> 01:15:40.173
Was that so difficult to figure out? I
mean, you're my science guy, right?

01:15:40.408 --> 01:15:43.025
Yon-Rogg will catch
up to us soon.

01:15:43.174 --> 01:15:45.697
We've got to get to the
core before he does.

01:15:45.705 --> 01:15:47.650
You're going to space?

01:15:47.728 --> 01:15:48.853
In what?

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.822
A few tweaks to your
vessel should do it.

01:15:50.853 --> 01:15:52.798
I can handle the modifications.

01:15:52.823 --> 01:15:54.845
Hmm. Your science guy.

01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:03.453
Well, I could use a co-pilot.

01:16:04.399 --> 01:16:07.297
No. No, I... I can't.

01:16:07.321 --> 01:16:09.821
- I can't leave Monica.
- Why?

01:16:09.852 --> 01:16:12.336
It's okay. I can stay
with grandma and poppa.

01:16:12.361 --> 01:16:14.580
There's no way I'm going baby.
It's too dangerous.

01:16:14.605 --> 01:16:18.384
Testing for new aerospace tech is
dangerous. Didn't you use to do that?

01:16:19.602 --> 01:16:23.126
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in
a craft not designed for the journey,

01:16:23.134 --> 01:16:27.634
and you anticipate hostile encounters with
a technologically superior foreign enemy.

01:16:27.665 --> 01:16:28.751
Correct?

01:16:29.267 --> 01:16:31.376
- That's what I'm saying. You have to go.
- Monica...

01:16:31.401 --> 01:16:33.868
You will just fly the coolest
mission in the history of missions.

01:16:33.884 --> 01:16:37.571
And you're gonna give it up to sit on the
couch and watch Fresh Prince with me?

01:16:38.438 --> 01:16:40.680
I just think you should
consider what kind of

01:16:40.705 --> 01:16:43.212
example you're setting
for your daughter.

01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:02.062
Your Mom's lucky.

01:17:02.554 --> 01:17:05.687
When they were handing out kids,
they gave her the toughest one.

01:17:06.063 --> 01:17:07.648
Lieutenant Trouble.

01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:09.664
You remember.

01:17:11.141 --> 01:17:12.445
Is that mine?

01:17:13.305 --> 01:17:14.500
Oh, no.

01:17:15.563 --> 01:17:17.930
You hang on to it
until I come back.

01:17:18.657 --> 01:17:21.258
But there is something that
I need your help with.

01:17:21.289 --> 01:17:23.680
I can't wear these
Kree colors anymore.

01:17:24.094 --> 01:17:28.648
And since you're obviously the only person
around here with any sense of style...

01:17:32.828 --> 01:17:33.828
Whoa.

01:17:37.125 --> 01:17:38.125
No.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560
Uh-uhh.

01:17:42.841 --> 01:17:44.474
Definitely not.

01:17:47.521 --> 01:17:49.988
Well, since we're
on the same team...

01:18:03.384 --> 01:18:04.767
How do I look?

01:18:08.533 --> 01:18:09.704
Fresh.

01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:31.412
What took you so long?

01:18:31.905 --> 01:18:34.537
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:37.068
- PRY46--
- Enough with codes.

01:18:37.115 --> 01:18:39.443
The system is fallible
as we've learned.

01:18:40.185 --> 01:18:41.997
Okay. Then let's do this.

01:18:42.387 --> 01:18:45.879
Who do I see, when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:48.605
A person you most admire
and respect, I guess.

01:18:48.731 --> 01:18:51.098
But you would never tell me who.

01:18:51.543 --> 01:18:54.534
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

01:18:54.559 --> 01:18:56.191
A transfusion.

01:18:56.254 --> 01:18:58.654
Blue blood running
through my veins.

01:18:58.723 --> 01:19:00.356
Whose blood?

01:19:10.318 --> 01:19:12.084
That is my blood,

01:19:12.171 --> 01:19:14.528
that's coursing
through her veins.

01:19:19.616 --> 01:19:23.014
- What have you done to her?
- You're too late.

01:19:39.699 --> 01:19:41.245
She knows?

01:19:55.121 --> 01:19:59.519
Ronan. Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.
Come at once.

01:19:59.544 --> 01:20:02.050
For the good of all
Kree, Commander.

01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:04.511
The infestation
will be eradicated.

01:20:06.723 --> 01:20:09.590
Passing 500 and climbing.

01:20:12.192 --> 01:20:15.246
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

01:20:15.271 --> 01:20:18.581
My alliance with you,
it's tenuous at best.

01:20:18.607 --> 01:20:22.661
But as long as he continues
to freak you out...

01:20:28.595 --> 01:20:30.280
Can I ask you something?

01:20:30.296 --> 01:20:32.358
You just turn into
anything you want?

01:20:32.383 --> 01:20:35.554
- Well, I have to see it first.
- Can you all do it?

01:20:35.579 --> 01:20:38.378
Physiologically, yeah. But...

01:20:38.403 --> 01:20:43.590
It takes practice, and dare I
say it, talent to do what...

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:45.418
Can you turn into a cat?

01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:46.376
What's a cat?

01:20:46.401 --> 01:20:48.160
What about a filing cabinet?

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.207
Why would I turn into
a filing cabinet...?

01:20:51.284 --> 01:20:55.127
A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right
now if you turn into a venus fly trap.

01:20:55.441 --> 01:20:59.465
Engine, this is scrammed jet fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

01:21:09.276 --> 01:21:13.314
- Is this normal, like space turbulence?
- Pretty much.

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:48.797
Locking in a coordinate grid.

01:21:49.336 --> 01:21:51.093
Where is it?

01:21:53.843 --> 01:21:56.273
It's here. It's gotta be here.

01:21:56.961 --> 01:21:59.046
Or is it in front?

01:21:59.109 --> 01:22:02.171
Or are we actually behind it?

01:22:07.948 --> 01:22:10.346
Decloaking activated.

01:23:12.627 --> 01:23:14.595
Is that it? The core?

01:23:14.611 --> 01:23:17.525
In her notes, she called
it the Tesseract.

01:23:25.413 --> 01:23:28.317
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.018
We're not alone.

01:24:05.762 --> 01:24:06.762
Talos!

01:24:17.036 --> 01:24:19.848
You didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

01:24:48.903 --> 01:24:50.645
We didn't know what to do.

01:24:50.653 --> 01:24:53.996
Mar-Vell warned us not to
send a signal for any reason.

01:24:54.021 --> 01:24:57.919
- Or the Kree would find us.
- You did the right thing.

01:25:07.439 --> 01:25:09.462
It's okay. It's okay.

01:25:09.517 --> 01:25:11.517
She's alright. She's a friend.

01:25:13.587 --> 01:25:15.243
I am not gonna hurt you.

01:25:15.321 --> 01:25:17.445
She led me to you.

01:25:17.744 --> 01:25:19.900
I'm so sorry.

01:25:21.205 --> 01:25:22.619
I didn't know.

01:25:22.783 --> 01:25:24.064
Carol...

01:25:24.408 --> 01:25:26.423
this is war.

01:25:27.181 --> 01:25:30.267
My hands are filthy
from it, too.

01:25:31.353 --> 01:25:35.681
But we're here now.
You found my family.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:44.892
This is just the beginning. There's
thousands of us separated from each other.

01:25:45.745 --> 01:25:48.424
Scattered throughout the galaxy.

01:26:06.511 --> 01:26:11.089
If I played the same pinball machine for
6 years, I'd have some high scores, too.

01:26:13.623 --> 01:26:15.954
Fraternizing with the enemy.

01:26:15.963 --> 01:26:16.963
Uh-uh.

01:26:29.026 --> 01:26:31.292
What did you do to your uniform?

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.338
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:35.315
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:38.128
You can see they're not soldiers.
Let them go.

01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:40.721
- You can have me.
- And the core?

01:26:40.869 --> 01:26:42.290
You lied to me.

01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:46.236
I made you a better
version of yourself.

01:26:49.636 --> 01:26:52.979
What's given can be taken away.

01:27:52.793 --> 01:27:54.121
There she is.

01:27:54.176 --> 01:27:58.129
Seems like you flying on
C-53 jogged the old memory.

01:27:58.559 --> 01:28:02.980
This jacket? It's
killer, by the way.

01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:07.548
The music, it's a nice touch.

01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:11.040
- Let... me... out.
- No can do.

01:28:11.253 --> 01:28:15.253
If you hurt them, I will
burn you to the ground.

01:28:15.292 --> 01:28:16.807
With what, exactly?

01:28:17.253 --> 01:28:20.838
- Your power comes from us.
- You didn't give me these powers.

01:28:20.855 --> 01:28:21.854
The blast did.

01:28:21.879 --> 01:28:25.401
And yet, you've never had the
strength to control them on your own.

01:28:35.676 --> 01:28:38.886
Species: Flerken. Threat: High.

01:28:44.499 --> 01:28:47.374
It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.

01:28:50.059 --> 01:28:51.715
Species: Human male.

01:28:51.731 --> 01:28:54.230
Threat: Low to none.

01:28:55.191 --> 01:28:56.628
That thing is clearly busted.

01:28:56.644 --> 01:28:58.761
Load the Flerken on the heli.

01:28:59.276 --> 01:29:01.394
Eject the others to space.

01:29:04.348 --> 01:29:06.378
You did good, ace.

01:29:07.871 --> 01:29:12.878
Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters
will threaten our borders no more.

01:29:12.918 --> 01:29:17.449
I used to believe your lies. But the
Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

01:29:17.832 --> 01:29:21.355
You're talking about destroying them
because they won't submit to your rule.

01:29:21.462 --> 01:29:22.704
And neither will I.

01:29:22.785 --> 01:29:23.923
We found you.

01:29:23.955 --> 01:29:26.962
- We embraced you as our own.
- You stole me.

01:29:27.396 --> 01:29:30.736
From my home. My family.
My friends.

01:29:38.617 --> 01:29:40.710
It's cute how hard you try.

01:29:42.757 --> 01:29:43.952
Remember...

01:29:45.351 --> 01:29:46.921
Without us...

01:29:46.968 --> 01:29:47.968
Give it up, Carol!

01:29:50.601 --> 01:29:51.835
... you're weak.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.678
You're flawed.

01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:58.928
Helpless.

01:30:02.531 --> 01:30:04.265
We saved you.

01:30:13.559 --> 01:30:16.433
Without us, you are only human.

01:30:18.082 --> 01:30:19.581
You're right.

01:30:20.746 --> 01:30:22.605
I'm only human.

01:30:56.649 --> 01:30:59.899
On Hala, you are reborn.

01:31:00.212 --> 01:31:01.453
Vers.

01:31:06.485 --> 01:31:09.758
My name... is Carol.

01:31:24.132 --> 01:31:26.022
She's trying to break out.

01:32:09.911 --> 01:32:13.378
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

01:32:14.263 --> 01:32:16.279
But what happens when...

01:32:18.974 --> 01:32:20.849
... I'm finally set free?

01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:04.138
You, know you're glowing, right?

01:33:04.179 --> 01:33:05.772
I'll explain it later.

01:33:07.945 --> 01:33:10.545
Take the Tesseract.
Leave the lunchbox.

01:33:10.796 --> 01:33:12.366
- Me?
- Yes.

01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:15.882
- I'm not touching that thing.
- Want me to get you an oven mitt?

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.793
Get the Skrulls from
the quadrant, and go.

01:33:30.879 --> 01:33:33.183
Take the Flerken with you.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.816
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time.

01:33:37.481 --> 01:33:40.004
I'm picking you up now.

01:33:42.543 --> 01:33:45.082
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

01:33:50.496 --> 01:33:51.923
Hey, guys.

01:33:55.095 --> 01:33:57.579
Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract?

01:33:59.947 --> 01:34:01.985
I used to find you amusing.

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:05.438
Let's put an end to this!

01:34:38.891 --> 01:34:40.117
Okay!

01:34:40.157 --> 01:34:41.648
Good kitty!

01:35:28.003 --> 01:35:29.549
You knew all along.

01:35:30.854 --> 01:35:32.103
Is that why we never hung out?

01:35:32.128 --> 01:35:34.354
No. I just never liked you.

01:35:49.826 --> 01:35:51.786
Hey! In a hurry?

01:35:53.255 --> 01:35:55.810
- Don't make me do this.
- Okay.

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.197
Now! Come on! Do your thing.

01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:19.705
Come on!

01:36:22.393 --> 01:36:24.893
Dammit, Goose. Pick a side.

01:36:29.153 --> 01:36:33.238
Take them to the hangar tube.
We'll blast them all into space.

01:36:35.161 --> 01:36:36.590
Play it cool.

01:36:37.793 --> 01:36:39.465
Just like Havana.

01:36:40.527 --> 01:36:44.831
- Do you have the thing?
- The Flerken kitty ate it.

01:36:57.915 --> 01:36:59.978
Come on. Move. Move!

01:37:00.955 --> 01:37:02.650
Follow my lead.

01:37:06.455 --> 01:37:08.212
Cover her eyes.

01:37:16.472 --> 01:37:19.315
Go to the ship. Let's go.
Let's go.

01:37:42.764 --> 01:37:44.373
Nice diversion.

01:37:44.467 --> 01:37:47.084
I could've swore, I
put it in there.

01:38:43.303 --> 01:38:46.686
- Minn-Erva, take them down in a dropship.
- On it.

01:38:51.376 --> 01:38:52.933
You all right, friend?

01:38:53.306 --> 01:38:55.086
Never... better.

01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:02.508
We've got a bogey.
Coming in hot.

01:40:41.739 --> 01:40:42.793
Yes!

01:41:04.126 --> 01:41:05.649
What the hell was that?

01:41:28.634 --> 01:41:30.728
Deploy ballistic warheads.

01:42:23.028 --> 01:42:24.645
That's impossible.

01:42:24.785 --> 01:42:29.582
C-53 doesn't have a defense system
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:33.729
That's not their
defense system, Ronan.

01:42:37.996 --> 01:42:39.637
Take her down.

01:43:49.586 --> 01:43:51.492
Return to the jump point.

01:43:52.664 --> 01:43:54.796
We'll be back for the weapon.

01:43:56.113 --> 01:43:57.566
The core?

01:43:59.367 --> 01:44:00.917
The woman.

01:44:48.528 --> 01:44:50.575
I'm so proud of you.

01:44:52.161 --> 01:44:55.567
You've come a long way since I
found you that day by the lake.

01:44:56.412 --> 01:45:00.091
But can you keep your emotions in
check long enough to take me on?

01:45:00.881 --> 01:45:03.396
Or will it get the better
of you, as always?

01:45:04.975 --> 01:45:06.678
I always told you...

01:45:06.865 --> 01:45:10.474
you'll be ready, the day you can
knock me down as yourself.

01:45:10.591 --> 01:45:14.450
This is that moment. This
is that moment, Vers!

01:45:15.045 --> 01:45:18.021
Turn off the light show,
and prove, prove to me,

01:45:18.037 --> 01:45:19.818
you can beat me with...

01:45:34.930 --> 01:45:37.125
I have nothing to prove to you.

01:45:52.618 --> 01:45:54.638
Destination: Hala.

01:45:54.728 --> 01:45:58.415
- I can't go back empty-handed.
- You won't be empty-handed.

01:45:58.689 --> 01:46:00.977
I'm sending you with a message.

01:46:01.103 --> 01:46:04.588
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

01:46:04.613 --> 01:46:07.760
The war, the lies, all of it.

01:46:09.058 --> 01:46:10.627
You can't do this.

01:46:29.298 --> 01:46:32.990
That was a close call, huh, Goosey?
Huh?

01:46:34.157 --> 01:46:36.539
The bad guy's still in
there somewhere--- Oh!

01:46:36.563 --> 01:46:38.032
Mother Flerken!

01:46:38.063 --> 01:46:41.195
- You okay?
- Yeah. It's just a scratch.

01:46:41.563 --> 01:46:42.734
No...

01:46:51.806 --> 01:46:54.634
I can't believe you got into
the raddest dogfight ever.

01:46:54.642 --> 01:46:56.811
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

01:46:56.836 --> 01:46:59.211
That's some nifty flying
you did out there.

01:46:59.234 --> 01:47:01.615
SHIELD could always
use a good pilot like you.

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.013
I'll consider it.

01:47:03.029 --> 01:47:06.107
As long as you don't call
my flying nifty again.

01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:08.411
How's your eye?

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:09.959
It never hurt a second.

01:47:09.984 --> 01:47:14.437
Just so I'm clear, you were
Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent?

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:15.461
Keller.

01:47:15.468 --> 01:47:18.001
Tagged my boss up,
stole his identity.

01:47:18.163 --> 01:47:20.921
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

01:47:20.952 --> 01:47:24.030
It's a little like thief.

01:47:24.218 --> 01:47:28.764
You're good to go ahead till you recover,
but you and your family need another look.

01:47:28.968 --> 01:47:31.678
- I could go back to being your boss.
- Please don't.

01:47:31.703 --> 01:47:34.467
Come on. I love sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

01:47:34.485 --> 01:47:39.360
No way, you guys have the best eyes.
Don't ever change your eyes.

01:47:42.964 --> 01:47:44.729
I'll help you find a home.

01:47:44.854 --> 01:47:47.080
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

01:47:48.878 --> 01:47:52.487
They can stay here with
us, can't they, Mom?

01:47:52.690 --> 01:47:55.222
They won't be safe here, baby.

01:47:55.332 --> 01:47:59.152
Auntie Carol is right.
They need their own home.

01:47:59.215 --> 01:48:01.964
I'll be back before you know it.

01:48:02.183 --> 01:48:04.574
Maybe I can fly up and
meet you halfway.

01:48:04.753 --> 01:48:07.346
Only if you learn how to
gloat, like your Auntie Carol.

01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:09.956
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.
You don't know.

01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:11.667
He doesn't.

01:48:20.695 --> 01:48:24.827
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.
Hidden.

01:48:24.874 --> 01:48:27.674
You're sure that's what
Marvel would want?

01:48:27.883 --> 01:48:30.335
- Mar-Vell.
- That's what I said.

01:48:30.367 --> 01:48:33.054
It's two words. Mar-Vell.

01:48:33.078 --> 01:48:34.296
Marvel.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.851
Marvel sounds a lot better. You
know, like the Marvelettes?

01:48:50.963 --> 01:48:52.220
Not ringing any bells?

01:48:52.245 --> 01:48:55.448
Keep singing. Maybe it
will come back to me.

01:49:09.408 --> 01:49:11.454
I upgraded it.

01:49:11.583 --> 01:49:15.043
Range should be, a couple
galaxies, at least.

01:49:16.489 --> 01:49:18.932
What? You think I'm
gonna crank call you?

01:49:18.957 --> 01:49:22.597
For emergencies only. Okay?

01:49:29.828 --> 01:49:32.085
Well, if you're ever
passing back through this

01:49:32.110 --> 01:49:34.655
galaxy, be sure to give
a brother a shout.

01:49:50.915 --> 01:49:53.036
We got the ketchup stain off.

01:49:58.463 --> 01:50:00.893
Thanks, Lt. Trouble.

01:50:09.501 --> 01:50:12.266
It's hard for me to
say goodbye, too.

01:50:25.663 --> 01:50:26.845
Go on.

01:51:34.215 --> 01:51:36.015
Glad to have you back, sir.

01:51:36.053 --> 01:51:37.611
This came for you.

01:51:41.491 --> 01:51:43.376
So, is it true?

01:51:43.955 --> 01:51:47.782
That the Kree burned your eye out because
you refused to give them the Tesseract?

01:51:48.812 --> 01:51:52.366
I'll neither confirm nor deny
the facts of that story.

01:51:52.531 --> 01:51:53.897
Understood.

01:51:55.398 --> 01:51:57.615
I'm sorry to report that we still
haven't found the Tesseract.

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:00.030
I'm sure it will
turn up somewhere.

01:52:01.351 --> 01:52:03.148
I'll let you know when it does.

01:52:03.172 --> 01:52:04.327
Then what?

01:52:05.508 --> 01:52:06.508
Sir?

01:52:06.617 --> 01:52:10.788
We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

01:52:10.828 --> 01:52:13.378
And our one-woman security
force had a prior

01:52:13.403 --> 01:52:16.390
commitment on the other
side of the universe.

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:21.704
SHIELD alone can't protect us.

01:52:22.837 --> 01:52:24.993
We need to find more.

01:52:25.111 --> 01:52:27.423
- More weapons?
- More heroes.

01:52:27.579 --> 01:52:29.258
You think we can find
others like her?

01:52:29.299 --> 01:52:32.173
We found her and we
weren't even looking.

01:52:33.416 --> 01:52:34.884
Get some rest, sir.

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.220
You got a big decision to make.

01:52:49.684 --> 01:52:54.924
CAPT CAROL "AVENGER" DANVERS.

01:53:14.489 --> 01:53:15.822
