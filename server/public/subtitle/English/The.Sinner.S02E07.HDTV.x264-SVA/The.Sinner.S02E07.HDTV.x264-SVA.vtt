00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:09.544
- Looks like somebody
was living here.

00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:13.483
Adam Lowry and Bess McTeer were
headed there with Julian...

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:15.395
and someone was waiting for them.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.676
The guy back at the dorms
with the ponytail...

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.450
I saw him at the motel when we
went to speak To the manager.

00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:21.905
- Marin is Julian's mother.

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:24.004
- Where is she?
- We have reason to believe

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:25.935
Her body was dumped in a lake

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:26.980
near Mosswood.

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:29.454
- There are abuses
all over Mosswood

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:30.884
and you were in charge.

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:33.409
- I allowed horrible things
to happen, I did.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:35.884
When I saw Julian's face...

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:37.895
I woke up...

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.945
and I knew what I had to do. And
I changed Mosswood for good.

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:43.085
- That hooded thing
that you keep seeing...

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:45.612
I'd stare it down next time you see it.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.644
'Cause it'll ruin you if you let it.

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:53.009
- Oh, shit.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.459
- All right, everyone,
- remain calm.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.045
- I need you to come inside
- right now.

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:29.944
Yep, put the baskets down.

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:31.995
- Leave what you have
- in your hands on the ground.

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:33.268
Put down the baskets.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.639
- Everybody sit down.

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:35.995
Legs out in front.

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.598
Cross your feet for me.
That's it. Cross your feet.

00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:41.350
- Hey, this is Private property.
- Ma'am, please sit down.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.004
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:45.965
- A warrant for what?
- A warrant For Julian Walker.

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:48.010
Julian Walker? What are you talking
about? He's in the custody

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:49.034
of Social Services.

00:02:49.045 --> 00:02:50.336
- Julian went missing

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.055
from the group home earlier this morning.

00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:55.004
- He went missing?

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:56.064
How?

00:02:56.074 --> 00:02:58.004
That's what we're trying to find out.

00:02:58.014 --> 00:02:59.372
- You mean you lost him?

00:02:59.373 --> 00:03:00.764
- Ma'am, please sit down.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:01.965
- He's not here!
- Right now.

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:03.499
You need to tell me what happened.

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.671
- Ms. Walker, just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:07.559
You took my son away from me,
and now you don't know

00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:09.406
Where he is, and you're
telling me to calm down?

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:10.985
- This is bullshit.
- Ma'am, you can't leave.

00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:12.352
- Ms. Walker!
- You can't leave.

00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:13.721
No, I can leave!

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.050
You get your hands off of me!
I have to find my son!

00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:16.965
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:17.925
You can't do this to me!

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.935
- Ms. Walker, be reasonable.
- No.

00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:22.743
You're wasting time.

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:23.925
Don't touch me!

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:29.381
You don't know what you're doing.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.944
- Come on.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:40.025
- And you saw him
go into the bedroom?

00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:41.954
- Yes.

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:43.260
And you heard nothing unusual?

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.422
- No.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.935
- Detective.

00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:55.925
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.025
Can you do me a favor?
I want to check upstairs.

00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:01.224
- Sure.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.144
- When did you realize
Julian was missing?

00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:25.084
4:40, maybe 4:45 a.m.

00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:27.431
None of the other kids saw anything?

00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:29.084
Nobody saw him leave?

00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:31.095
- Everybody was asleep.

00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:46.403
Oh, he wrote that number there.

00:04:46.414 --> 00:04:47.985
I... I don't know whose it is.

00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:52.055
- It's mine.

00:04:53.514 --> 00:04:55.464
How was his mood last night?

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:58.383
- Honestly, he seemed...

00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:00.373
dissociated.

00:05:09.503 --> 00:05:12.337
- Do you keep sunflower seeds
in the house?

00:05:13.524 --> 00:05:15.496
- Not usually, no.

00:05:19.474 --> 00:05:21.584
Hey... hey!

00:06:05.524 --> 00:06:07.534
Next time my brother
has a party, I'm bringing you.

00:06:07.544 --> 00:06:09.433
Fine. I don't want to see you like

00:06:09.443 --> 00:06:11.433
- Throwing up all over the floor.
- Yeah.

00:06:12.493 --> 00:06:14.414
- This guy, right here.

00:06:14.423 --> 00:06:16.433
You, like... you get sick
from, like, too much candy.

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:17.483
Such a lightweight.

00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:22.414
- How you doing?

00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.006
- It's just nicotine.
- I don't care about that.

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:28.854
You guys see anything parked
in that spot lately?

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:31.483
- Yeah.
Fucking camper van.

00:06:31.493 --> 00:06:33.483
Took a piss on the back tire
and it honked.

00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:36.414
Scared the shit out of me.

00:06:36.423 --> 00:06:38.544
You happen to see who it was
that was inside?

00:06:38.553 --> 00:06:40.493
- Window had curtains.

00:06:40.503 --> 00:06:42.113
Anybody remember anything else?

00:06:42.123 --> 00:06:43.453
License plate, anything like that?

00:06:43.464 --> 00:06:44.553
- It was a shitty brown.

00:06:46.503 --> 00:06:48.524
- Was this last night?
- Yeah.

00:06:55.503 --> 00:06:57.822
- The hell are you doing here?
- Just hang on.

00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:00.464
We gotta call and get an Amber Alert.

00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.544
Julian didn't run away, he was abducted.

00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:05.514
There was a van that was across
from the foster house.

00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:07.474
That means it might not be
Vera Walker after all.

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:09.404
Wait, slow down. What do you mean, a van?

00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:11.514
- There was a brown camper van.

00:07:11.524 --> 00:07:13.454
It was seen
in the parking lot last night.

00:07:13.464 --> 00:07:14.534
- Detective Ambrose.

00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:18.334
I thought I made it clear

00:07:18.344 --> 00:07:19.454
you weren't needed here anymore.

00:07:19.464 --> 00:07:20.553
- Yeah, we got a missing child.

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:22.553
I'm not going home until we find him.

00:07:22.563 --> 00:07:25.464
Look, there was a van
that was parked across

00:07:25.474 --> 00:07:26.546
from the foster home.

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:28.423
Someone was stalking Julian.

00:07:28.433 --> 00:07:30.423
They were there last night, waiting.

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.464
- Hold on, hold on.
Who are "they"?

00:07:32.474 --> 00:07:34.020
- I don't know.

00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:36.453
But we need an alert.

00:07:36.464 --> 00:07:39.323
Look, I could be wrong,
but I think I'm right.

00:07:40.514 --> 00:07:41.553
Chief.

00:07:41.563 --> 00:07:43.772
Julian Walker is slipping away from us.

00:07:43.782 --> 00:07:45.822
- We don't have time...
- This is Heather Novack, Keller PD.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:49.563
We need an Amber Alert
For Julian Walker, age 13.

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:51.433
Possible abduction.

00:07:51.443 --> 00:07:54.514
We're looking for a brown camper van.

00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:07.268
- Did you have nightmares?

00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:13.208
- I did.

00:08:14.297 --> 00:08:16.188
What about you?

00:08:16.198 --> 00:08:18.023
Do you have those?

00:08:18.907 --> 00:08:20.106
- Yeah.

00:08:24.218 --> 00:08:26.573
- Still nothing on N.C.I.C.

00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:31.148
- He was telling me all along

00:08:31.157 --> 00:08:33.378
there was a hooded thing
coming after him.

00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:36.398
It was all real.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.090
I need to talk to her.

00:08:53.427 --> 00:08:56.102
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

00:08:57.177 --> 00:09:00.437
If you really are, then get
them to let me out of here.

00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:03.723
You'd have to cooperate first.

00:09:03.732 --> 00:09:04.872
- Cooperate?

00:09:04.882 --> 00:09:07.388
They lost my son,
and then they raided my home

00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:09.207
and accused me of taking him.

00:09:09.218 --> 00:09:11.201
I've got nothing to say.

00:09:12.157 --> 00:09:14.053
- I had nothing to do
with that raid.

00:09:16.177 --> 00:09:19.437
- And yet here you are, on the
other side of this table.

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:28.148
There was a van... a brown camper van...

00:09:28.157 --> 00:09:30.398
That was parked across
from the foster home.

00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:34.218
- That's who took him?

00:09:34.228 --> 00:09:36.187
- Who'd want to do that?

00:09:39.427 --> 00:09:42.437
You know who's driving
that van, don't you?

00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:46.444
Vera...

00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:50.323
We're gonna lose him.

00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:55.245
We have to work together.

00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:03.398
- I want to speak to my lawyer.

00:10:08.197 --> 00:10:09.509
- You...

00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:16.641
You hurt him when you do that.

00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:20.268
You know, what you're doing
right now, you're hurting him.

00:10:21.437 --> 00:10:25.207
- Harry, saving my son
isn't gonna save you.

00:10:28.756 --> 00:10:30.096
- What's that mean?

00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:39.268
- Harry.

00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:41.228
We got something.

00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:46.561
- What?

00:10:49.258 --> 00:10:51.111
What is it?

00:11:13.268 --> 00:11:15.177
- You touch anything?
- No.

00:11:15.187 --> 00:11:16.338
It was just like this.

00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:18.207
- Canadian plates.

00:11:18.218 --> 00:11:19.729
Have you run those yet?

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.919
- Yeah. The plates were reported
stolen off another vehicle

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:25.207
in Quebec three weeks ago.

00:11:33.723 --> 00:11:36.417
Looks like they ditched this in a hurry.

00:11:44.358 --> 00:11:47.167
We'd better get the dogs out here.

00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:17.895
Hey.

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:19.094
Heather.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.844
It has knots.

00:12:32.854 --> 00:12:34.895
Like a cincture.

00:12:34.905 --> 00:12:36.834
- A cincture?

00:12:36.844 --> 00:12:37.834
- Yeah.

00:12:37.844 --> 00:12:40.935
It's a type of belt that's worn by monks.

00:12:40.944 --> 00:12:45.815
As a kid, I learned that the Franciscans
tied three knots in theirs.

00:12:46.045 --> 00:12:48.905
- Let's find out
who wears five.

00:12:50.844 --> 00:12:52.171
- Yeah.

00:12:52.854 --> 00:12:54.935
- They're charging you
with resisting arrest.

00:12:54.944 --> 00:12:57.200
I expect they're gonna hold you overnight

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.834
- before they release you.
- None of that matters Right now.

00:13:00.844 --> 00:13:03.662
I need you to go find Terry
and give him a message.

00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:07.854
Tell him to go see The Grey Daughters.

00:13:19.339 --> 00:13:23.248
- Well, the five knots stand
for poverty, chastity,

00:13:23.258 --> 00:13:26.339
obedience, enclosure, and detachment.

00:13:26.349 --> 00:13:27.581
- Ah.

00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:30.168
- And every nun wears
- one of these...

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:32.319
Just like this?
- Every nun of our order.

00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:34.368
- How many are in your order?

00:13:34.378 --> 00:13:38.288
- Well, we have convents all
over the Northeast and Canada.

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:42.248
I'd say over 500 sisters active today.

00:13:42.258 --> 00:13:44.339
- I need a list of their names

00:13:44.349 --> 00:13:46.339
- Sure.

00:13:46.349 --> 00:13:49.248
- And who else
would have access

00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:51.388
to the habits that the sisters wear?

00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:54.299
- Well, uh, we have laypeople
coming through...

00:13:54.309 --> 00:13:55.349
- It's her.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.828
- And volunteers,
maintenance people...

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:59.258
- It's her.

00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:01.339
- Excuse me.

00:14:01.349 --> 00:14:02.512
What?

00:14:04.368 --> 00:14:06.378
- Marin.

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:09.288
I don't understand...

00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:13.309
- Sister, uh,
there's a woman here...

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.388
do you know...

00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:16.859
the woman right there?

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.319
- Oh, of course.

00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:20.168
That's Laura.

00:14:21.268 --> 00:14:22.359
- Laura.

00:14:22.368 --> 00:14:25.309
- She's... she was living here
for some time.

00:14:25.319 --> 00:14:27.309
She left just a few weeks ago.

00:14:27.319 --> 00:14:28.238
- Hmm.

00:14:31.648 --> 00:14:33.349
Laura came in three years ago.

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:35.827
We help run a recovery center

00:14:35.838 --> 00:14:38.299
and she admitted herself.

00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:41.744
She got sober and ended up
staying on with us.

00:14:41.745 --> 00:14:43.168
- For three years?

00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:45.189
- Almost.

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:46.398
She was quite dedicated.

00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:49.180
Well, she... she also struggled.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.290
Nothing came easy for her.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.161
I had hoped that she would take her vows,

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.111
but that's not what she wanted.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.151
This was her room.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.001
It's so strange... her
father's looking for her, too.

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:08.080
He came here just last night.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.080
- Her father?

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.080
- He picked up a box
of Laura's belongings.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.161
I didn't get his name.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.101
- What'd he look like?
- Um...

00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:21.170
Long hair... grey...
tied back in a ponytail.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.190
- How long ago did you say
she left?

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.930
- I would say...
must have been four

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.080
or five weeks ago.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.991
Is she okay? Did something happen?

00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:44.090
- It's important
that we find her.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.001
Did she say where she was going?

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.920
- She wouldn't say.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.991
- Marin, my God.

00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:57.920
Welcome home.

00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:12.872
We've made a lot of changes
since you left. For the better.

00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:16.161
You have no idea how much we missed you.

00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:19.180
- I missed you too.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.101
- We have a bed for you.
- I can have D'Nell

00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:22.136
Get it ready for you.

00:16:22.137 --> 00:16:23.161
- I'm not staying.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.719
I'm here for Julian.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.348
- What do you mean?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.141
I wanna thank you for
everything You've done for him,

00:16:35.142 --> 00:16:38.101
and everything you tried
to do for me, but I'm ready

00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:40.141
to be his mom again.

00:16:42.717 --> 00:16:44.028
- Again?

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.572
- I want him back.

00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:49.151
I need to be with him.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.141
I know you haven't had
an easy time since you left us.

00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:57.101
I heard about rehab in Providence.

00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:58.950
And in Manchester.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.151
- I've been clean three years.

00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:05.141
I've worked the steps.
I'm a different person now.

00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.151
- Marin...

00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:10.010
you're a stranger to Julian.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.121
To disturb things now at his age, that...

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.687
that would be harmful.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.121
So you never told him about me?

00:17:18.131 --> 00:17:20.022
- I didn't see the point.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.662
- You left us.
- We had no idea

00:17:22.687 --> 00:17:24.318
If you were ever coming back.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.151
- You knew what
I was going through

00:17:27.161 --> 00:17:29.190
- and you took advantage of that.
- I did everything I could do

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.499
- To help you.
- You took over

00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:32.551
Being his mother
and you didn't give any room

00:17:32.576 --> 00:17:36.111
- For me.
- Marin, you barely wanted To hold him.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.168
- I want to see him.

00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:45.131
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:46.970
- You can't just decide that.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.161
- I can.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.170
I have a legal right.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.972
You abandoned him,
and I'm his mother now.

00:17:54.161 --> 00:17:56.950
And now I think you should leave, please.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.563
- Marin?

00:18:02.764 --> 00:18:04.014
- Please go.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.000
- Hey, get out of here!
- Who's up here?

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.950
- What are you doing in here?
- You can't be here.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.190
- Get off me!

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.960
He's mine!

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.180
He's my kid!

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.090
He's my kid!

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.081
- What the hell are you doing?
- What's going on?

00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:38.980
Leave her alone.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.950
Marin, are you okay? Marin?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.061
Hey...

00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:43.960
- I have no idea. I don't know.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.980
- She needs to get off
the grounds.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.071
- It's okay.

00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:48.960
I've got her.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.950
It's okay. Come on.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.151
It was only a dream.

00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:07.170
It was only a dream.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.911
- Please, Bess.
You know this isn't right.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.990
You were...

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.980
You were there.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.020
You know.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.081
- I know.

00:20:34.091 --> 00:20:35.551
- Please.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.180
I really need your help.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.930
Hello?

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.911
Hey. Uh, we're on the road.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.200
Everything's going fine.

00:20:52.911 --> 00:20:54.716
You didn't have any problems

00:20:54.726 --> 00:20:56.081
Getting away? No one followed you?

00:20:57.635 --> 00:20:59.960
- Uh, no, no.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.075
We're all good.

00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:04.180
- How is he?
- He's enjoying the drive

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.020
in the big, wide world.

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.091
We all are.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.970
- Bess...

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.920
Thank you.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.619
- We'll... we'll check in...

00:21:16.629 --> 00:21:19.170
later, okay? When we get closer.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.020
- Okay.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.184
- Vera sends you a kiss.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.161
When we get to Niagara Falls,
how close up can we get?

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.030
- Well, uh,

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.911
you get in these big boats,
and it takes us

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.930
right up to where the water's
coming down.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.101
Right up to the edge.

00:21:37.111 --> 00:21:39.041
If we're lucky, we might
actually see some people

00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:40.076
Coming over in barrels.

00:21:40.077 --> 00:21:43.190
- Barrels?
- It's a thing at Niagara Falls.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.238
- $7.50.

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:16.111
Would you like a bag with that?

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.141
You aren't real.

00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:03.020
You aren't!

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.990
You aren't real!

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.460
You're not... you're not real!

00:23:08.461 --> 00:23:09.920
- Shh.

00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:11.980
- It's okay.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.980
- It's okay.
- Hey, it's okay.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.950
Shh.

00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:20.272
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

00:23:20.282 --> 00:23:22.030
Okay. It's okay.

00:23:22.041 --> 00:23:24.020
I'm gonna get you out of here.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.020
How? Who are you?

00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:29.920
- It's gonna be okay.

00:23:38.071 --> 00:23:39.990
- Where are we going?

00:23:45.081 --> 00:23:46.990
Where are we going?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.525
Mosswood isn't this far.

00:23:48.535 --> 00:23:50.980
- Everything's gonna be
okay soon, I promise.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.970
- Where are you taking me?

00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:55.267
Where are you taking me?

00:23:55.292 --> 00:23:57.071
I'm just here To help you out.
Don't worry.

00:23:57.081 --> 00:23:59.020
I'll explain everything once we get

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.061
A little bit further, okay?

00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:16.629
Who are you? Who are you?

00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:18.733
I'll tell you as soon as we
get a little further out.

00:24:18.743 --> 00:24:20.950
Tell me now! Tell me who you are!

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.081
- Tell me who you are right now!
- Hey! Hey, stop it!

00:24:22.091 --> 00:24:24.020
- No!
- Hey, sit down!

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.940
- Hey, stop it!
- I'm gonna jump out!

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.940
- Tell me who you are!
- Julian, stop!

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.091
- Sit down!
- Tell me who you are!

00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:31.041
- Stop it! Stop!

00:24:31.051 --> 00:24:32.990
- Stop it!
- No!

00:24:34.091 --> 00:24:35.400
Julian, stop it!

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.408
- Stop it! Stop!

00:24:37.418 --> 00:24:38.911
Please! Can you just look at me

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.091
For one second?

00:24:40.101 --> 00:24:43.010
- I'm your mom!
I'm your mother!

00:24:45.061 --> 00:24:47.081
I'm sorry. I'm your mom.

00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:52.975
I'm sorry.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.180
I didn't want to tell you
like that, but I...

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.051
we just don't have very much time,

00:25:00.061 --> 00:25:01.990
And once we get a little bit
further out, I will...

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.236
I will tell you everything, okay?
I promise.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.960
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:25:07.991 --> 00:25:09.010
- Hey, hey.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.101
I really don't want to do this,
but I just can't have you

00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:13.030
Jumping out of the van, and we
really don't have much time.

00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.404
Once we get to somewhere else, I'll...

00:25:17.101 --> 00:25:19.041
Julian!

00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:21.030
Julian!

00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:23.161
Stop!

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.960
Please stop!

00:25:28.656 --> 00:25:30.485
- Julian!

00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:34.616
Julian!

00:25:37.465 --> 00:25:38.656
Hey.

00:25:38.666 --> 00:25:40.545
It's okay.

00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:41.706
I'm sorry.

00:25:41.715 --> 00:25:44.715
I'm sorry about what happened back there.

00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:55.666
I know Vera never told you about me...

00:25:56.646 --> 00:25:58.745
But I used to live at Mosswood, too.

00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:02.646
It's where I gave birth to you.

00:26:03.626 --> 00:26:05.686
I chose your name.

00:26:07.686 --> 00:26:09.656
You don't...

00:26:09.666 --> 00:26:11.475
remember me...

00:26:11.485 --> 00:26:13.475
do you?

00:26:21.515 --> 00:26:23.676

- Bess sang that to me.

00:26:46.735 --> 00:26:49.656
- I used to sing that to you
all the time.

00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:52.686
She learned it from me.

00:26:56.265 --> 00:26:58.636
Can you just give me a chance?

00:26:59.545 --> 00:27:01.656
If, after a few days,
you want to go back,

00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:04.398
I'll bring you back. I promise.

00:27:05.565 --> 00:27:07.715
I just want to get to know you.

00:27:11.947 --> 00:27:14.495
You must be starving.

00:27:16.998 --> 00:27:18.998
I have this.

00:27:21.032 --> 00:27:23.012
It's okay.

00:27:29.215 --> 00:27:31.656
It's just a granola bar.

00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:33.495
So...

00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:48.725
Is it okay?

00:27:52.676 --> 00:27:54.715
- Found the vehicle.
All clear.

00:28:05.495 --> 00:28:08.666
- It's okay, honey.
Let's go this way.

00:28:08.676 --> 00:28:10.575
Come on.

00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:15.706
Any ideas where she'd be taking him?

00:28:15.715 --> 00:28:17.515
- No clue.

00:28:17.525 --> 00:28:20.515
- She's not dangerous, right?
I mean, he's safe.

00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:22.505
- She just wants him back.

00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:24.706
I don't think she would hurt him.

00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:27.465
- Yeah, but we don't know
for sure.

00:28:30.465 --> 00:28:32.676
I think we ought to add her
to the Amber Alert.

00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:48.515
What?

00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:53.456
- All she ever wanted
was a family.

00:28:55.902 --> 00:28:57.982
She was always at our house.

00:28:59.205 --> 00:29:01.195
Birthdays...

00:29:02.104 --> 00:29:04.075
Holidays...

00:29:04.696 --> 00:29:07.525
Any excuse to come over, she was there.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.525
She never wanted to go home.

00:29:15.475 --> 00:29:17.864
- I'd say you did everything
you could.

00:29:20.485 --> 00:29:22.525
- No, I didn't.

00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:25.660
I ruined it for her.

00:29:27.485 --> 00:29:30.018
I did it back then, and now
I gotta do it again.

00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:42.096
Yeah, I have to update the Amber Alert

00:29:42.097 --> 00:29:43.485
for Julian Walker.

00:29:43.495 --> 00:29:46.893
He's traveling with a female,
30 years old.

00:29:47.555 --> 00:29:50.495
- My mother says that
I'm not guilty...

00:29:52.515 --> 00:29:54.515
But I know that I am.

00:29:58.456 --> 00:29:59.745
I did it.

00:30:01.745 --> 00:30:03.706
I did it.

00:30:05.616 --> 00:30:07.735
- It's more complicated
than that.

00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.475
- Can we go?

00:30:26.626 --> 00:30:28.465
- Who else?

00:30:28.475 --> 00:30:30.465
- Anthony, Misha,

00:30:30.475 --> 00:30:32.545
Grace, and J.B.

00:30:32.555 --> 00:30:35.495
I tried to stop them
but you weren't here.

00:30:35.505 --> 00:30:37.495
Everybody's getting fed up.

00:30:37.505 --> 00:30:41.505
- Of course they're getting fed up.
This is supposed to be a sanctuary.

00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:43.555
- What do you want to do?

00:30:44.626 --> 00:30:47.465
- I want to find my son
and bring him home.

00:30:47.475 --> 00:30:48.696
- Even if you get him back,

00:30:48.706 --> 00:30:51.715
they're never gonna let you keep him.

00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:54.505
You understand that, right?

00:31:03.485 --> 00:31:06.456
- This is all that Marin left
at The Grey Daughters.

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:09.545
But...

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:11.515
I found this.

00:31:12.636 --> 00:31:14.626
I know where she's going.

00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:27.452
- Let's go to the back.

00:31:28.356 --> 00:31:29.527
- Where are we going?

00:31:29.537 --> 00:31:31.248
- Niagara Falls.

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:34.507
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:31:34.517 --> 00:31:35.586
Here, let's go here.

00:31:42.336 --> 00:31:43.457
- Laura,

00:31:43.458 --> 00:31:44.577
this is Sister Joanne.

00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:47.507
The police were here looking for you.

00:31:47.517 --> 00:31:50.577
One of them said she's
an old friend of yours.

00:31:50.586 --> 00:31:53.537
Apparently they have
an Amber Alert out for you

00:31:53.547 --> 00:31:55.577
and I'm very worried.

00:31:55.586 --> 00:31:59.072
Please call and let us know
that you're okay.

00:31:59.073 --> 00:32:00.537
Can you do that?

00:32:18.446 --> 00:32:20.507
- Why did you leave?

00:32:20.517 --> 00:32:21.715
- What?

00:32:22.606 --> 00:32:25.346
- If you're really my mother...

00:32:26.052 --> 00:32:28.547
Why did you leave?

00:32:30.567 --> 00:32:33.059
- Because I felt like
I failed.

00:32:33.935 --> 00:32:35.520
- Failed at what?

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:39.356
- Being your mom.

00:32:40.537 --> 00:32:42.557
Being worthy.

00:32:43.987 --> 00:32:45.822
- So where did you go?

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.426
- A lot of places,

00:32:50.436 --> 00:32:52.596
most of them not so good.

00:32:54.507 --> 00:32:56.557
Got into drugs.

00:32:56.567 --> 00:32:58.585
Then I got sober...

00:33:00.126 --> 00:33:02.346
tried religion...

00:33:05.467 --> 00:33:08.577
But I could never get rid of this pain.

00:33:11.376 --> 00:33:12.808
- What pain?

00:33:13.975 --> 00:33:15.685
- Of missing you.

00:33:16.547 --> 00:33:19.336
I thought about you all the time.

00:33:20.547 --> 00:33:21.900
How you were...

00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:24.606
who you were.

00:33:54.577 --> 00:33:57.567
- We should get gas.
- We still have 1/4 of a tank.

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:59.855
- Let's just fill it up.
Please.

00:34:00.557 --> 00:34:02.023
- Bess...

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.694
Bess and Adam...

00:34:07.397 --> 00:34:09.377
They were...

00:34:10.386 --> 00:34:13.386
They... they were trying
to take me to you,

00:34:13.397 --> 00:34:15.078
weren't they?

00:34:22.607 --> 00:34:26.557
- And I killed them.
- Hey. You didn't know.

00:34:37.386 --> 00:34:39.337
Julian...

00:34:39.346 --> 00:34:41.357
Julian, hey...

00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:42.587
- Get off me.

00:34:46.477 --> 00:34:49.045
Hey, hey, hey.

00:34:49.054 --> 00:34:51.346
Julian, hey.

00:34:52.607 --> 00:34:54.397
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:56.386
Julian! Julian! Be quiet. Okay?

00:34:56.397 --> 00:34:59.466
Julian! Come here, come here.

00:34:59.477 --> 00:35:01.346
We're getting...

00:35:01.357 --> 00:35:03.406
We're getting off, okay?

00:35:09.397 --> 00:35:11.406
- Heather Novack.

00:35:13.357 --> 00:35:14.607
Hello?

00:35:19.616 --> 00:35:21.144
- It's me.

00:35:31.587 --> 00:35:33.477
- Hey.

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:37.357
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:35:37.366 --> 00:35:39.377
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:35:42.426 --> 00:35:44.557
- Can't believe it's you.

00:35:52.596 --> 00:35:54.302
Is Julian okay?

00:35:55.346 --> 00:35:56.805
- He's good.

00:35:57.587 --> 00:35:59.486
Everything's okay.

00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:02.557
I know you're looking for me.

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.397
- Where are you?

00:36:10.003 --> 00:36:12.417
- You have to leave us alone.

00:36:13.616 --> 00:36:16.406
- This is bigger
than just me, Marin.

00:36:16.417 --> 00:36:19.366
There's a lot of people looking
for you and Julian.

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.426
- You could hold them off
for a day.

00:36:21.437 --> 00:36:23.486
- Marin, just come back.

00:36:23.497 --> 00:36:25.346
I'm on your side.

00:36:25.357 --> 00:36:27.426
I know Julian's your son. I know...

00:36:28.577 --> 00:36:30.596
What you've been through.

00:36:34.346 --> 00:36:35.578
- No, you don't.

00:36:36.967 --> 00:36:39.497
- Then help me understand.

00:36:39.506 --> 00:36:42.386
Tell me where you are
and I'll come meet you.

00:36:44.386 --> 00:36:46.417
We can figure this out together.

00:36:48.386 --> 00:36:50.417
Please.

00:36:50.426 --> 00:36:53.377
- You could throw them
off course,

00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:55.377
buy me some time.

00:36:57.506 --> 00:37:00.426
I've never had anything.

00:37:00.437 --> 00:37:02.446
This is the only thing I want.

00:37:07.446 --> 00:37:09.397
- I can't.

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:14.691
- Fine.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.437
I have to go.

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:19.406
- Wait, Marin...

00:37:19.417 --> 00:37:20.897
- What?

00:37:26.397 --> 00:37:27.607
I'm sorry.

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.572
- It's not your fault.

00:37:57.851 --> 00:38:00.504
- She called me on this phone.
I need a ping right away.

00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:01.696
- These are exigent
- circumstances,

00:38:01.721 --> 00:38:03.731
We've got a missing child.

00:38:05.672 --> 00:38:06.661
- Come on.

00:38:06.672 --> 00:38:08.641
Come on, we're here.

00:38:18.198 --> 00:38:19.501
- I'm hungry again.

00:38:19.512 --> 00:38:21.007
Is there something we can eat?

00:38:21.008 --> 00:38:23.661
- I'm hungry, too. Can you
just sit tight for a second?

00:38:23.672 --> 00:38:25.495
I just have to make a phone call.

00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:02.866
Hi.

00:39:03.692 --> 00:39:05.672
It's me.

00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:09.123
We're here.

00:39:21.532 --> 00:39:22.969
- Got it.

00:39:26.857 --> 00:39:29.058
She could be anywhere by now.

00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:31.077
She's probably trying for the border,

00:39:31.088 --> 00:39:33.855
But she's not gonna
make it across with Julian.

00:39:36.692 --> 00:39:38.541
Five Nations.

00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:40.572
- What's that?
- Right here.

00:39:40.581 --> 00:39:42.592
Take a look at this.

00:39:42.601 --> 00:39:46.284
Indian reservation straddles
both sides of the border.

00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:53.114
I bet that's how she's planning
on getting across.

00:39:58.552 --> 00:39:59.622
- Yeah, all right.

00:39:59.623 --> 00:40:00.692
Thanks, Brick.

00:40:00.701 --> 00:40:03.541
They ID'd our girl in the lake.

00:40:03.552 --> 00:40:05.581
Britt Jacobs.
She was a patient at Deacons,

00:40:05.592 --> 00:40:07.155
Went missing several years ago.

00:40:07.164 --> 00:40:09.091
She had no connection with Mosswood.

00:40:09.102 --> 00:40:11.512
Probably committed suicide.

00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:17.572
- Okay, here we are.

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.601
Five Nations.

00:40:24.532 --> 00:40:27.572
Okay, looks like these guys
are onto something.

00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:28.977
What do you think?

00:40:30.632 --> 00:40:32.532
- Let's follow them.
