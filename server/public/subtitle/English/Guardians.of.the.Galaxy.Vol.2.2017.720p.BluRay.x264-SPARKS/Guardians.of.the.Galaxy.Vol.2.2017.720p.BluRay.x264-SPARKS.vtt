00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.229
<i>There's a girl in this harbor town</i>

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.358
<i>And she works layin' whiskey down</i>

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.868
<i>They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"</i>

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.998
<i>And she serves them whiskey and wine</i>

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.199
<i>The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"</i>

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.148
<i>"What a good wife you would be"</i>

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.157
- Come on!
- Slow down!

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.231
This way, my river lily! Come on!

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.189
Where are you taking me?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.360
Come on, come on.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.711
Look. Look!

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.876
Oh, it's beautiful!

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.031
I was afraid
it wouldn't take to the soil...

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.514
but it rooted quickly.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.280
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.512
All across the universe.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.871
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.632
but I like the way you say it.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479
My heart is yours...

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.192
Meredith Quill.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.710
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.476
Showtime, a-holes!

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.429
It will be here any minute.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.352
Which will be its loss.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.959
I thought your thing was a sword?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.280
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.120
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.360
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.119
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.636
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.108
It hurts.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280
It hurts?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.473
I have sensitive nipples.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.319
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.038
What about him? What's he doing?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.754
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.148
How is that a priority?

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.675
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.432
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.999
That's hardly important right now.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.435
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.513
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.150
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.358
I can clearly see you winking.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.751
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.154
I am Groot.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.920
They were not looking at you funny.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.792
Well, that's intense.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200
Groot!

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.909
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.080
Hi.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.795
No! Spit it out!

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.109
Come on!

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.519
Disgusting!

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.033
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.232
I must cut through it from the inside.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520
Huh?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.034
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200
Drax!

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.199
What is he doing?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.121
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.216
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.896
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.478
I realize that.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.390
There is a cut on its neck.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.790
Rocket, get it to look up.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.713
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.079
Watch it, Quill!

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.831
Yes! I have single-handedly...

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.560
vanquished the beast!

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.349
What?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.713
What are they called again?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.514
Anulax batteries.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.035
Harbulary batteries.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.509
That's nothing like what I just said.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.480
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.560
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.195
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.992
The cost of transgression is death.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.479
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.633
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.234
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.637
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.070
We control the DNA of our progeny...

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.355
germinating them in birthing pods.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.150
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.800
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.511
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.671
For academic purposes.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.757
I would be honored, yes.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.911
In the name of research...

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.594
I think that could be pretty, uh...

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.034
repulsive.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.240
I'm not into that kind of casual...

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.515
Oh, please.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.990
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.434
Bring it...

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.238
and we shall gladly be on our way.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.594
Family reunion. Yay.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.194
I understand she is your sister.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.558
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.192
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.117
Do with her as you please.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.437
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.400
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.079
My mother is from Earth.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.158
And your father?

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.792
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.279
I see it within you.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.992
An unorthodox genealogy.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.398
A hybrid that seems particularly...

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.959
reckless.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.032
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.470
but that isn't true at all.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.800
Oh, shit.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.956
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.390
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.240
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.072
You're telling me.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.435
You wanna buy some batteries?

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.588
<i>All right,
let's get baldy to Xandar</i>

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.113
<i>and collect that bounty.</i>

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.396
That stuff about my father...

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.671
Who does she think she is?

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.149
I know you're sensitive about that.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.520
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.078
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.913
I wasn't.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.190
I don't care if you were.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.157
Well, I feel like you do care.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.550
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.950
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.995
Damn shadow.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.191
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.032
those who dance, and those who do not.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.078
Mmm-hmm.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.431
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.600
Oh, God.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.513
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.238
Except one woman.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.033
My Ovette.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.876
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.634
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.555
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.516
Wouldn't move a muscle.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.399
One might assume she was dead.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.959
That does sound pretty hot.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.199
It would make
my nether regions engorge.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.237
Okay. I get it, yes.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.311
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.916
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240
Mmm.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.153
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.793
No. It's not ripe yet...

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.995
and I hate you.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.468
You hate me?

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.359
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.590
And yet here you stand, a hero.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.553
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.314
I swear.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.595
No.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.557
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.153
in a prison on Xandar...

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.639
wishing you could.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.669
This is weird.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.696
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.856
Why would they do that?

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.496
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520
Dude!

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040
Right.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.320
He didn't steal some of those.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.641
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.191
What were you thinking?

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.736
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.193
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.635
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.518
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.914
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.576
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.280
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.112
I was being sarcastic!

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.349
Oh, no!

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.696
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.755
Now I look foolish!

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.536
Can we put the bickering on hold...

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.596
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.518
- More incoming!
- Good!

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.159
I wanna kill some guys!

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.400
You're not killing anyone.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.073
All those ships are remotely piloted.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.600
Damn it!

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.151
What is the delay, Admiral?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.393
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.856
and could destroy the entire fleet.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.599
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.437
We hired them and they steal from us.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.920
It is heresy of the highest order.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.911
<i>All command modules...</i>

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.674
<i>fire with the intent to kill.</i>

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.798
What's the nearest habitable planet?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.153
It's called Berhert.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.038
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.192
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.193
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.040
Quill, to make it through that...

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.816
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.875
Lucky for us, I...

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.473
I am.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:43.996
What are you doing?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.320
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.392
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.313
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.840
Stop it.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.816
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.976
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.416
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.320
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.070
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.799
Oh, it won't be my turd.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.313
It will be Drax's.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.632
I have famously huge turds.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.514
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Son of a...

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.599
Dude! Seriously!

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200
Hey! Let me...

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.914
Idiots!

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.160
Well, that's what you get

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.633
when Quill flies.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.273
Ow!

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.715
We still have a Sovereign craft
behind us.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.471
Our weapons are down.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.710
20 clicks to the jump!

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720
Hold on.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.116
It's not ripe.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.190
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.392
Yes!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.591
15 clicks to the jump!

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.195
Come on!

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.479
Keep going!

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.915
10 clicks!

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.318
Die, spaceship!

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.394
You suck, Zylak.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.595
Typical.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280
Five clicks!

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.633
Son of a...

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.911
They went around the field!

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.475
Someone destroyed all our ships!

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.868
What?

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.557
Who?

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.033
One click!

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.997
- What is that?
- Who cares?

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.434
That's the jump point! Go!

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.918
It's a guy.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.870
Oh, my God.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.473
He's still out there?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.790
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.875
Prepare for a really bad landing!

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.516
That was awesome!

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.909
Yes!

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.354
Look at this!

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.712
Where is the other half of our ship?

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880
My ship.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.749
Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.136
had you flown with
what's between your ears

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.639
instead of what's between your legs!

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.153
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.436
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.400
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.080
More like because he stole...

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.309
the Anulax batteries!

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.755
They're called Harbulary batteries.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.552
No, they're not!

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.392
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.680
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.711
I did it because I wanted to!

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.517
Dick.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.597
What are we even talking about this for?

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.228
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400
How little?

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.635
Well, I don't know, like this?

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.478
A little one-inch man saved us?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.880
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.315
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.799
Don't call me a raccoon!

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.634
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.754
I meant trash panda.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.314
Is that better?

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.552
I don't know.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.950
It's worse. It's so much worse.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.348
You son of a...

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.236
Hey!

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.896
- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.960
Someone followed you
through the jump point.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.875
Set me free, you'll need my help.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.155
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.336
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.696
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720
No, I won't.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.156
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.276
I bet it's the one-inch man.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.875
After all these years, I've found you.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.358
And who the hell are you?

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.471
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.870
My name is Ego...

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.639
and I'm your dad, Peter.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.680
You know what they say...

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.718
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.919
Yondu!

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.596
Come on down!

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.396
After going around
years in circles...

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.437
with this woman I end up marrying.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.279
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.873
"but you're losing your mind!"

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.996
Then again, she's always been that way.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.957
I could never trust her. You know?

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.120
Stakar.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.078
It's been some time.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.193
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240
- Sir!
- Stakar!

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.789
There's a hundred
Ravager factions.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.958
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.633
Please, sir. Please!

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.068
Get away from me.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.313
You can go to hell then!

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.636
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.837
So what are you following us for?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.496
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.953
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.359
You betrayed the code!

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.351
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.353
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520
You didn't know because

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.216
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.390
I demand a seat at the table!

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.550
I wear these flames, same as you.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.790
You may dress like us...

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.480
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.437
And the Colors of Ogord...

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.990
will never flash over your grave.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.679
If you think...

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.031
I take pleasure in exiling you...

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.398
you're wrong.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.558
You broke all our hearts.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.549
Ah, pathetic.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.671
First, Quill betrays us...

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.116
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.429
We followed him
because he was the one...

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.034
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.470
Seems he's goin' soft.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.469
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.917
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.471
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.238
Who the hell is that?

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.952
Yondu Udonta...

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.790
I have a proposition for you.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.396
<i>I hired Yondu to pick you up...</i>

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.676
when your mother passed away.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.637
But instead of returning you...

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.637
Yondu kept you.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.394
I have no clue as to why.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.993
Well, I'll tell you why.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.559
Because I was a skinny little kid

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.296
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.833
It made it easier for thievin'.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.276
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.536
I thought Yondu was your father.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.630
What? We've been together
this whole time...

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.598
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.988
You look exactly alike.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.798
One's blue!

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.078
No, he's not my father!

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.708
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.816
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.831
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.353
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.511
Oh, that son of a bitch.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.033
How'd you locate us now?

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.832
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.429
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.989
What say we head out there right now?

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.800
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.868
I promise you...

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.351
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.349
And there...

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.515
I can explain your very special heritage.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.671
Finally get to be...

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.559
the father I've always wanted to be.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.513
Excuse me.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.399
I've gotta take a whiz.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.278
I'm not buying it.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.192
Let's go take a walk.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.399
I am Mantis.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.559
What are you doing?

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.233
Smiling.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.514
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.750
Not if you do it like that.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.275
Oh...

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.920
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.790
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.835
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.715
Yes.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.635
That is called a practical joke!

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.951
I liked it very much!

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.792
I just made it up!

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.640
Give me a break!

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560
After all this time,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.096
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.917
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.150
And by the way,
this could be a trap.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.878
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.712
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.835
But what?

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.309
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.435
Who?

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.828
He owned a magic boat?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.154
David Hasselhoff?

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.150
Right.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.390
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.560
Why did he talk again?

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.235
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.994
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.912
and you would tell
all the other children...

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.230
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.914
Shooting <i>Knight Rider</i>
or touring with his band in Germany.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.496
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.589
I love that story.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.716
I hate that story.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.313
It's so sad!

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.517
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.353
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.792
That's my point, Peter.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.473
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.353
If he ends up being evil...

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.398
we will just kill him.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.160
You're leaving me with that fox?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.315
He's not a fox.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.556
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.996
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.550
It'll be just a couple of days.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.558
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.631
<i>What if the Sovereign come?</i>

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.016
There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.632
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.392
God, you're like an old woman.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.232
Because I'm wise?

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.156
Why do you have
so much luggage?

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.470
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.120
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.954
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.910
Because it's working.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.553
<i>And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again</i>

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.754
<i>I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain</i>

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.912
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.192
<i>You will never love me again</i>

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.273
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.431
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.797
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.599
<i>You will never love me again</i>

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.792
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.350
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.356
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.760
Oh...

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.475
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.399
Your antennae, what are they for?

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.149
Their purpose?

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.151
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.390
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.475
I say...

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.029
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.998
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.310
Right.
And if it's anything other than...

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.870
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.508
They are not for feeling doorways.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400
I think...

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.319
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.880
What are those?

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.550
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.472
- You read minds?
- No.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.915
Telepaths know thoughts.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.514
Empaths feel feelings.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.680
Emotions.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.475
May I?

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.033
All right.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.749
You feel love.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.392
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.709
No!

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.711
Romantic, sexual love.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.319
No, I don't.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.078
- For her!
- No!

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.675
Okay.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.870
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.349
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.839
You must be so embarrassed!

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.557
Do me! Do me!

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.878
I have never felt such humor!

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.391
So unbelievably uncool.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.193
Oh, Quill.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.519
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.509
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.680
Yeah, like what?

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.677
If I touch someone who is sad...

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.513
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.548
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.757
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.794
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.109
Do one of those on me.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.272
Sleep.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.680
I love this song.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280
Huh?

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.754
There!

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.400
Ah...

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.714
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys...

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.996
are you?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.035
Move!

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.955
Crap.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.993
Hey there, rat!

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.469
How's it going, you blue idiot?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.036
Not so bad.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.589
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.593
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.673
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.840
because she wants

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.438
to kill y'all.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.828
Your friend...

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.672
There's too many of them.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.037
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.834
you need to get me out of these bonds.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.351
They are going to kill him!

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.670
I tell you,
it was pretty easy to find you.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.756
I put a tracer on your ship back there...

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.279
during the war over Xandar.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.189
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.237
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.469
Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.190
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.713
Otherwise, you'd what?

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.399
We'll take them batteries.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.036
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.509
That Priestess offered us a million.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.439
A quarter is only one third of that!

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.715
A quarter ain't a third.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.677
A quarter is 25.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840
No.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.309
We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.475
Enough!

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.475
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.348
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.071
That ain't right!

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.277
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.749
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.798
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.960
Yeah!

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.633
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.800
Take it easy, Kraglin.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.388
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.637
Suppose it's time for a change
in leadership.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.990
Put your damn guns down!

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.434
Whoa! Whoa!

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.036
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.913
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.752
Well, hello, boys.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.998
It's not ripe.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.270
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.828
Wow.
You have your own planet?

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.708
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.433
Humility.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.999
I like it.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.715
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.358
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.757
What are you exactly?

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.151
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.994
A Celestial, like a god?

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.754
Mmm, small "g," son.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.713
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.040
Whoa!

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.470
I don't know where I came from exactly.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.596
First thing I remember is flickering...

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.071
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.514
and entirely alone.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.511
Over millions of years...

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.275
I learned to control
the molecules around me.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.712
I grew smarter and stronger.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.718
And I continued building from there...

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.996
layer by layer...

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.754
the very planet you walk on now.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.194
Whoa.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.949
But I wanted more.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.838
I desired...

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.469
meaning.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.639
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.553
"besides just me," I thought.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.753
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.553
I created...

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.349
what I imagined biological life
to be like...

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.274
down to the most minute detail.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.753
Did you make a penis?

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.114
Dude!

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.508
What is wrong with you?

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.672
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.840
He would smush her!

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.275
I don't need to hear how my parents...

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.520
Why?

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.872
My father would tell the story

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.871
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.473
That's disgusting.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.073
It was beautiful.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.839
You Earthers have hang-ups.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.470
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.358
Ha! Thank you!

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.635
It's not half bad.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.233
- Oh.
- Ugh.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.035
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.952
and all the accompanying junk.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:34.070
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.232
as I set out amongst the stars...

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.115
until I found...

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.952
what I sought.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.709
Life.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.749
I was not alone in the universe after all.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.391
When did you meet my mother?

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.232
Not long after.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.676
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.751
I called her my river lily.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.514
And from that love, Peter...

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.354
you.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.155
I have searched for you for so long.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.432
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.354
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.078
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.069
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.037
This is mutiny!

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:27.828
This is mutiny!

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.033
You're scum!

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.954
Oh!

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.629
Captain!

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.360
Help me! Please!

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.073
Captain!

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.032
You're the one what killed those men...

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.437
by leading them down the wrong path.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.958
Because you're weak.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.953
And stupid!

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.076
It's time for the Ravagers...

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.915
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.438
Taserface!

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.789
I'm sorry. Your name is...

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.598
It's Taserface?

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.399
That's right.

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.075
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.557
It's metaphorical!

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720
Yeah!

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.320
For what?

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.194
For it is a name what strikes fear...

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.113
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.028
Okay.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.868
Okay...

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.229
whatever you say.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.079
You shut up.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.434
You're next.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.673
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.920
What?

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.072
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.277
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.512
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.114
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.549
"Taserface!"

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.200
That's how I hear you in my head!

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.270
What was your second choice?

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.271
Scrotum Hat?

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.200
New plan. We're killing you first.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.677
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.833
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.833
That's enough killing for today.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.478
She's the daughter of Thanos.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.016
I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.873
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.669
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.673
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.833
I assure you...

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.833
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.831
or a talking woodland beast.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.071
I want 10% of the take...

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.518
and a couple more things.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.998
We got
a whole box of hands...

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.991
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.357
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.752
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.356
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.198
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.669
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.956
What are you gonna do with your share?

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.155
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.077
battle one another in training.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.189
Every time my sister prevailed...

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.670
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.513
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.431
But she won...

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.435
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.389
So after I murder my sister...

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.709
I will buy a warship

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.791
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.589
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.193
piece by piece...

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.750
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.037
I know every single day.

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.273
Yeah.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.520
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.231
Or a nice hat.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.119
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.277
Anyways, happy trails.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.516
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.794
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.995
Peter...

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.056
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.479
But you left...

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.438
the most wonderful woman ever...

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.119
to die alone.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.710
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.030
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.593
and the light within it...

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.318
this form will wither and perish.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.520
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.551
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.956
I loved your mother, Peter!

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.475
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.473
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.029
I know exactly what that feels like!

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.952
I had to watch her die!

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:14.472
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.108
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.155
But you're not one of them.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.709
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.710
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.552
and the light within.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.117
They are a part of you, Peter.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.632
What do you mean?

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.351
Give me your hands, son.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.475
Here.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.237
Hold them like that.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.038
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.158
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.911
Yes!

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.078
Whoa!

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.593
Yes! It's okay.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:15.829
Just relax. Concentrate.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.110
You can do it. Bring it back.

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.749
Yes!

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.198
Yes, now shape it.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.232
Feel that energy.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400
Yes.

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.039
You're home.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.749
Peter...

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.158
How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.678
Ego found me
in my larva state.

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.273
Orphaned on my homeworld.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.800
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.679
So you're a pet?

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.279
I suppose.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.155
People usually want cute pets.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.595
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.079
I am hideous?

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.390
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.635
But that's a good thing.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.840
Oh?

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.872
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.474
you know they love you for who you are.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.195
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.993
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.671
Those pools,
they remind me of a time...

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.355
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.834
She was like you.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.753
Disgusting?

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.989
Innocent.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.200
Drax?

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.512
There's something I must tell you.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.069
What's going on?

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.117
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.670
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.593
You're not ugly. Drax!

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.079
What are you talking about?

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.389
Mantis...

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.911
can you show us where we'll be staying?

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.280
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.510
The planet is Ego.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.915
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.914
And you're not a flea?

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.429
I'm a flea with a purpose.

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.638
I help him sleep.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.952
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.075
Nothing.

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.917
Your quarters are this way.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.990
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.437
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.156
Okay, Taserface.

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.990
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.559
"Hi," Taserface!

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.234
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.953
No, Gef.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.792
It's too adorable to kill.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.791
Take it to the tailor.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.631
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.830
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.159
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.717
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.677
But I was young...

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.076
and greedy, and stupid.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.156
Like you stealing those batteries.

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.833
That was mostly Drax.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:56.829
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.109
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.991
The only family I ever had.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.112
When I broke the code...

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.032
they exiled me.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.793
This is what I deserve.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.672
Slow down, drama queen.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.518
You might deserve this, but I don't.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.432
We gotta get outta here.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.035
Where's Quill?

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.758
He went off with his old man.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.198
- Ego?
- Yeah.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.316
It's a day for dumbass names.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.829
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.753
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.308
You like a professional asshole or what?

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480
Pretty much a pro.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.233
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.598
He was skinny.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.112
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600
Uh-huh.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.237
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.714
But we're gonna need your little friend.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.235
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.675
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.479
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.517
He's goddang precious!

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.280
Psst!

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.278
Hey, twig!

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.999
Come here.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.708
Come on.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280
Aw, man...

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.913
what did they do to you?

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.474
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.517
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.719
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.512
the thing I wore on my head.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.279
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.754
You got it?

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.999
That's my underwears.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.376
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.391
You have to explain it more careful.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.350
It's a prototype fin.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.593
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.352
You explain it this time.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.039
All right.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.757
That's Vorker's eye.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.911
He takes it out when he sleeps.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.433
Go. Look again.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.999
But leave the eye here.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.475
Why?

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.993
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.555
and he's not gonna know...

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.950
where his eye is!

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.718
That's a desk.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.593
We told you it was this big.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.755
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.639
with a bunch of severed human toes.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.395
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.355
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.873
Okay?

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.277
What? No!

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.696
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.039
That's not what I said!

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.200
I am Groot.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.456
He's relieved you don't want him to.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.959
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:24.791
I am Groot.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.149
On anyone, not just himself.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.150
I am Groot.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.296
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.176
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.474
That's why you don't like hats?

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.955
This is an important conversation
right now?

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.680
That ain't it.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.033
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.911
They killed all my friends.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.474
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200
One more thing.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.349
You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.549
Ah.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.151
He's got it!

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.833
<i>Yondu's got the fin!</i>

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Go!

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.440
Down there!

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.991
Oh!

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.513
You maniac.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.755
The whole ship's gonna blow.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.272
Not the whole ship.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.275
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.718
I am sending you
the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.077
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.754
I only ask one thing.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.878
That your High Priestess...

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.510
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.717
Taserface!

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.308
Where to, Captain?

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.480
Ego.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.155
No, boy!

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.591
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760
I know that.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.235
We are about to do 700!

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.236
So I guess this could
all be mine someday.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.114
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.078
What are you doing, Peter?

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.679
Dance with me.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.353
I'm not going to dance with you.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.278
This is Sam Cooke...

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.991
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.151
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.840
If you ever tell anyone about this...

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.399
I will kill you.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.039
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.079
What unspoken thing?

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.232
This...

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.198
<i>Cheers,</i> Sam and Diane...

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.920
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.536
but never say it because if they do,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.680
the ratings would go down...

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.869
sort of thing.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.473
There's no unspoken thing.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.436
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.669
then it would be spoken...

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.599
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.918
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.991
No, that's not what I...

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.359
What we should be discussing right now
is something about this place.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.232
It doesn't feel right.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.950
What are you talking about?

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.536
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.788
That girl Mantis...

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.029
she's afraid of something.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.516
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.875
I'm not trying...

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.951
He's my father. He's blood.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.936
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.076
Again, you made me come here!

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.296
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.959
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.873
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.400
That's the half I'm worried about.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.678
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.189
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.874
You were insufferable to begin with.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.336
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.856
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.838
You know what?
This is not <i>Cheers</i> after all!

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.833
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.718
to open themselves up
to new possibility,

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.472
and the other person is a jerk...

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.437
who doesn't trust anybody!

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.272
It's a show that doesn't exist.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.920
That's why it would get zero ratings!

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.476
I don't know what <i>Cheers</i> is!

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.638
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.518
I thought you already had.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.268
Damn it.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.429
Psychopath!

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.552
Are you kidding me?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I win.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.795
I win. I bested you in combat.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.871
No. I saved your life.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.871
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040
You let me live!

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.957
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.536
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.754
just because I wanted to win.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.558
Do not tell me what I want.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.200
I don't need to tell you what you want!

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240
It's obvious!

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.358
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.753
You were all I had.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.793
But you were the one
who needed to win.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.315
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.111
and my brain from my skull...

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.157
and my arm from my body...

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.916
because of you.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.955
You all right, son?

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.959
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.953
Yeah.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.838
It's fortuitous...

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.228
you listening to this song.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.958
- You know...
<i>- Brandy?</i>

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.475
By Looking Glass?

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.800
A favorite of your mom's.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.153
Yeah, it was.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.360
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.510
Perhaps its very greatest.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.680
Yes!

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.957
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.992
<i>He came on a summer's day</i>

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.948
<i>Bringing gifts from far away</i>

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.508
Like the child I put in your mother...

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.591
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.797
<i>Brandy, you're a fine girl</i>

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.599
<i>What a good wife you would be</i>

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.359
<i>My life, my love</i>

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.796
<i>My lady is the sea</i>

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.791
The sea calls the sailor back.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.474
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:04.193
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:08.916
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.676
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.955
No, Peter...

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.071
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.630
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.715
I'm immortal?

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.240
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.075
Really?

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.073
Yes! As long as the light exists.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:30.311
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.789
like how you made this whole planet?

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.315
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.755
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.920
What!

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.670
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.875
and Heather Locklear.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.200
You can do anything you want.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.674
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.991
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.674
Only we can remake the universe.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.308
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.313
and lead it to where it needs to go.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.515
How?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.353
Come with me.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.952
Drax, Drax. Drax!

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.958
Drax! We need to talk.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.951
I'm sorry.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.315
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.549
What?

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.951
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.513
No, that's not what I...

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.519
What are you doing?

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.469
I'm imagining being with you physically.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.959
Drax...

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.629
I don't like you like that.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.149
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.754
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.480
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.398
I should have told you earlier.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.592
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360
What is that?

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.396
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.712
Everything around us,
including the girl...

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.350
Everything is temporary.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:26.318
We are forever.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.953
Doesn't eternity get boring?

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.509
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.636
which is why you're here.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.956
I told you how all those years ago...

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:39.238
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.439
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.394
it was all so...

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.711
disappointing.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.555
<i>And that is when I came...</i>

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.395
to a profound realization.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.873
My innate desire to seek out other life...

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:07.632
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.029
Peter...

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.277
I have found meaning.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.513
I see it.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.712
Eternity!

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.639
Oh, my God.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.157
We need to get off this planet.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.274
Oh, man.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.789
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.838
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.990
What the hell you doing, boy?

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.150
I could tell
by how you talked about him...

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.639
this Ego is bad news.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.438
We're here to save Quill.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.639
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.792
No. I don't care about those things.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.190
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.113
I can lord this over him forever.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.712
What are you laughing at me for?

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.070
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.514
I know who you are.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.830
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.275
I know everything about you.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.229
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.896
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.920
Shut up!

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.315
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.074
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.656
because just a little bit of love...

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.956
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.588
I said shut up!

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.152
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.639
I'm serious, dude!

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.360
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.397
their own little baby, into slavery.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.270
I know who you are, boy.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.471
Because you're me.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.070
What kind of a pair are we?

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.437
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.672
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.474
Fight a what?

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Who are you people?

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.120
What is this place?

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.240
Gamora, let her go!

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.436
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.909
You are scared.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:11.318
I call it the Expansion.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.750
It is my purpose...

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.435
and now it is yours as well.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.753
It's beautiful.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.275
Over thousands of years...

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.591
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.479
on thousands of worlds.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.428
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.477
To grow and spread...

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.757
covering all that exists...

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.999
until everything is...

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.400
Me!

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.430
What did she do to me?

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.232
She already told me everything.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.960
I only had one problem.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.672
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.716
for such an enterprise.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.996
But two Celestials...

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.470
Well, now, that just might do.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.593
The bodies...

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.635
are his children.

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.394
<i>Out of all my labors...</i>

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.797
the most beguiling was...

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.356
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.432
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.431
to power the Expansion.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:30.034
<i>I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.</i>

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.590
<i>It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...</i>

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.514
<i>and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.</i>

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.240
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.716
But one after the other, they failed me.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.714
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.029
Until you, Peter.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.920
Out of all my spawn...

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.193
only you carried
the connection to the light.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.238
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.994
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.599
- Then we just go.
- No!

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.030
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.350
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.873
You're right.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.435
We're family.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.873
We leave no one behind.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.634
Except maybe you.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.719
Oh, my God.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.510
For the first time in my existence...

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.592
I am truly not alone!

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.309
What is it, son?

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.829
My friends.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.239
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.560
Yes.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:50.912
We are beyond such things.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.080
Yes.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.628
- Now...
- But my mother...

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.909
You said you loved my mother.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.593
And that I did.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.709
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.193
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.874
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.598
I'd never leave.

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.278
The Expansion...

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.035
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.236
So, I did what I had to do.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.430
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.869
What?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.598
Now, all right...

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.398
I know that sounds bad.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:56.876
Who in the hell do you think you are?

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.598
You killed my mother!

01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.795
I tried...

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.712
so hard...

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.359
to find the form...

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.909
that best suited you...

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.389
and this is the thanks I get?

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.589
You really need to grow up.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:19.078
I wanted to do this together...

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.196
but I suppose you'll have to learn

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.590
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.992
Finally! Rocket?

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.993
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.357
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.936
<i>to slice open the Bank of A 'askavaria.</i>

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.960
Ego's unhinged.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.479
<i>I know. Get ready.</i>

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:39.914
Drop her, Kraglin.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.669
No.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.673
<i>My life, my love</i>

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.035
<i>My lady is the sea</i>

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.315
Peter...

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.315
this is the sea.

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:25.400
Oh...

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.192
Hey, there, jackass!

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.033
What is that thing?

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.391
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.913
I told you something didn't feel right.

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.389
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.232
Well, I came back, didn't I?

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.240
Because there's an unspoken thing.

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.430
There is no unspoken thing.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.440
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:48.478
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.834
We had it under control.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.315
We did not.
That is only an extension...

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.516
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.954
What's Smurfette doing here?

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:58.031
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.428
She tried to murder me!

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.591
I saved you, you stupid fox!

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.028
He's not a fox.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.270
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.440
I am Groot.

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.039
"Raccoon." Whatever.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:12.879
How do we kill a Celestial?

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.473
There's a center to him.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.756
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.040
Some sort of protective shell.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.515
It's in the caverns...

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:20.680
below the surface.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.873
Yondu?

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.675
Thrusters are out.

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.071
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.200
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:40.496
You still reckon that's the reason

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.680
I kept you around, you idiot?

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.440
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.080
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.792
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.552
You said you were gonna eat me.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.119
That was being funny!

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.154
Not to me!

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.548
You people have issues.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.438
Of course I have issues.

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.198
That's my freakin' father!

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.958
Thrusters are back up.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.710
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.388
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.959
We have to kill him.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:22.791
Rocket!

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:23.960
Got it!

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.674
Whoo-hoo!

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.711
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.915
I guess.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.080
Awesome!

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.390
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.198
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.920
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.839
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.280
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.192
and all the animals on the planets.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.554
And the people.

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.914
Meh.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:05.479
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.240
<i>Pilots...</i>

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.753
release envoy units.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.079
<i>Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.</i>

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.029
Dive!

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.359
Um... Captain?

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.559
<i>Captain?</i>

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.192
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.496
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.715
to help destroy the universe.

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.070
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.355
So, could you?

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:31.714
A little.

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.108
I made a ball.

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.280
A ball?

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:36.158
I thought as hard as I could.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.798
It was all that I could come up with.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.279
You "thought"?

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.550
You think when I make this arrow fly...

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.551
I use my head?

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.359
Whoa.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.120
There.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.236
That's Ego's core.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.238
That ore is thick, Rocket.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.038
I got it covered.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.839
We must hurry.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.036
It will not take Ego long to find us.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.554
Keep it steady.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.996
We drill into the center, we kill him!

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.748
<i>Captain?</i>

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.195
What is it, Kraglin?

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.316
<i>Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?</i>

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.791
- Yeah, why?
<i>- Uh...</i>

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.274
Oh, hell!

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.472
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.638
They blew out the generator.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.598
I think I packed a small detonator.

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.456
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.959
Well, we got these.

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.756
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.837
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.672
throughout his entire nervous system.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.630
Meaning what?

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.353
The entire planet will explode.

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.953
We'll have to get out of here fast.

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.712
I rigged a timer.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.749
Go!

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.678
He's coming.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.838
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.749
When he wants. He's too powerful.

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.239
I can't!

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.637
You don't have to believe in yourself...

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.396
because I believe in you.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.800
Sleep!

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.840
I never thought she'd be able to do it...

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.150
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.992
I don't know how long I can hold him.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.992
The metal's too thick.

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.476
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.960
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:48.600
<i>Well...</i>

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.231
That's a terrible idea.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.675
<i>Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.</i>

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.159
Unbelievable.

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.515
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:03.599
<i>What a day.</i>

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.755
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.069
That activates it.

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:18.077
Then you push this button...

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.317
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.754
Now, whatever you do...

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.789
don't push this button...

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.030
because that will set off
the bomb immediately

01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.599
and we'll all be dead.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.154
Now, repeat back what I just said.

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.992
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.236
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.515
- I am Groot.
- No!

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.269
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.440
Try again.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:43.829
Hmm...

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.232
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:48.550
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.720
I am Groot.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:51.631
No! That's exactly what you just said!

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.392
How is that even possible?

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.790
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.029
Point to it.

01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.200
No!

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.272
<i>Hey, you're making him nervous!</i>

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.192
Shut up and get me some tape!

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.840
Does anybody have any tape out there?

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.632
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.678
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:11.513
<i>Yo, Yondu... Ow!</i>

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.790
<i>Do you have any tape?</i>

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.157
<i>Gamora? Do you have any tape?</i>

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.355
<i>Tape!</i>

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.954
<i>Never mind. Ow!</i>

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.394
<i>Drax, do you have any tape?</i>

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:29.153
<i>Yes, Scotch tape would work.</i>

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.400
<i>Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,</i>

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.999
<i>if you don't have any?</i>

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.228
Nobody has any tape!

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.759
Not a single person has tape?

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160
Nope!

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.475
Did you ask Nebula?

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.031
Yes!

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.514
Are you sure?

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.999
I asked Yondu...

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.376
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.656
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:51.069
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:54.755
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:57.428
You are wasting a lot of time here!

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.035
Whee!

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:05.711
We're all gonna die.

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.556
Rear thrusters are out again!

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.473
We're done for without that generator!

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.068
<i>Guardians...</i>

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.552
<i>perhaps it will provide you solace...</i>

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.314
<i>that your deaths
are not without purpose.</i>

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.438
<i>They will serve as a warning...</i>

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.989
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.318
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.149
This is gonna hurt.

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.833
Promises, promises.

01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.280
Hey!

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:10.920
No!

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.636
No! No! No!

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.120
<i>We're gonna blow!</i>

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.311
Peter! No!

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.240
What?

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.551
You look like Mary Poppins.

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.119
Is he cool?

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.558
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.197
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.596
Mantis, look out!

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.312
She's just unconscious.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.918
How long until the bomb goes off?

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.435
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.749
about six minutes.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:10.314
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.480
<i>T-minus five minutes.</i>

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:12.789
Aye, Captain.

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.560
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.353
Drax, take Mantis.

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.514
Ow! My nipples!

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.394
Gamora!

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.755
Peter!

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.399
Get over it.

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.589
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.117
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.671
Yeah!

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:53.389
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.152
So stop pissing me off!

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.040
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.160
Go!

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.152
I told you...

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:33.154
I don't want to do this alone.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:37.395
You cannot deny...

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:41.832
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.798
Everyone,
I need you to stay back!

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:53.960
What is that?

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.915
<i>It doesn't need to be
like this, Peter.</i>

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.072
Why are you destroying our chance?

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.957
<i>Stop pretending you aren't
what you are.</i>

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.800
<i>One in billions.</i>

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.391
<i>Trillions. Even more.</i>

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.117
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.873
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.357
I use my heart...

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:24.309
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:28.075
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.589
<i>You will never love me again</i>

01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:33.633
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:37.753
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.871
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:42.680
<i>You will never love me again</i>

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:47.592
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.553
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.194
<i>And if you don't love me now</i>

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.352
<i>You will never love me again</i>

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:59.279
<i>I can still hear you saying</i>

01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:01.960
<i>You would never break the chain</i>

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:07.552
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:10.757
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:12.798
Groot, hurry!

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:10.710
Yondu, we're about to blow!

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.353
Get to the ship!

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.555
Not without Quill!

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.877
You need to take care of the twig!

01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:18.958
Not without you!

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:23.510
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.996
You need to give me this.

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:38.240
Uh...

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.788
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.070
I only have one of each.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.958
I am Groot.

01:53:58.760 --> 01:53:59.829
What's that?

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:05.758
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.635
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:16.029
Bye, twig.

01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.430
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.160
Where's Peter?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.956
Rocket, where is he?

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.680
Rocket.

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.398
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.040
Mmm...

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.195
No. I'm not leaving without him.

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.200
I'm sorry.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.798
I can only afford to lose
one friend today.

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:45.360
Kraglin, go!

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:47.240
Wait...

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.558
Is Quill back?

01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:53.514
Rocket, where's Quill?

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.916
Rocket, where's Quill?

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:00.308
<i>Rocket!</i>

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:02.360
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.311
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:16.870
No, we need to stop it.

01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:23.075
Stop.

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.438
Stop. Listen to me!

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.153
You are a god.

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.073
If you kill me...

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.708
you'll be just like everybody else.

01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.478
What's so wrong with that?

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:36.640
No!

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.390
He may have been your father, boy,

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:30.953
but he wasn't your daddy.

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.669
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:41.035
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:47.314
What?

01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:59.069
Yondu, what are you doing?

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:00.355
You can't.

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.640
Yondu!

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.993
No!

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:15.600
No!

01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.192
Oh! Aww...

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.394
No! No!

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:24.031
Oh, no!

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.359
I told Gamora...

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:22.391
how when I was a kid I used to pretend

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:24.277
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.794
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:33.197
Earlier, it struck me...

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:38.558
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.435
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:43.875
but he did have the whistle of one.

01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:47.509
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:50.160
and hooked up with hot women...

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.276
and fought robots.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.993
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:00.229
Only it was you, Yondu.

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:08.797
I had a pretty cool dad.

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.439
What I'm trying to say here is...

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:20.116
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:24.789
it's right there by your side all along.

02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:26.757
You don't even know it.

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:40.313
I am Groot.

02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:43.472
He did call you twig.

02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:47.239
Nebula...

02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.156
I was a child like you.

02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:59.193
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.318
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.238
I'm trying to make it right.

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:05.839
There are little girls like you...

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.833
across the universe who are in danger.

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:12.999
You can stay with us and help them.

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:15.955
I will help them by killing Thanos.

02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:18.196
I don't know if that's possible.

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.236
You will always be my sister.

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:20.560
Pete!

02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:25.992
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.993
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:31.915
What is it?

02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:33.080
It's called a Zune.

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:35.056
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.672
It's got 300 songs on it.

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:39.115
300 songs?

02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.349
Wait.

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.360
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:55.954
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.713
Thanks...

02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:03.788
Captain.

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.599
<i>It's not time to make a change</i>

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.429
<i>Just relax, take it easy</i>

02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.309
<i>You're still young, that's your fault</i>

02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:57.358
<i>There's so much you have to know</i>

02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:01.718
<i>Find a girl, settle down</i>

02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.952
<i>If you want you can marry</i>

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:10.518
<i>Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy</i>

02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:17.199
They came.

02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.713
What is it?

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:29.920
I sent word to
Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.433
and told them what he did.

02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.918
It's a Ravager funeral.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.320
Yeah!

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.399
Yeah!

02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:06.591
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.352
No, he did not, son.

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:11.793
He did not.

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:21.791
Fare thee well, old friend.

02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:28.916
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.956
He didn't chase them away.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:36.235
No.

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.316
Even though he yelled at them.

02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:40.993
And was always mean.

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:45.756
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:52.958
Well, of course not.

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:18.309
What?

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.149
It's just...

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:25.434
some unspoken thing.

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:36.676
It's beautiful.

02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.354
It is.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.996
And so are you.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.228
On the inside.

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:54.838
<i>Now there's a way</i>

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.999
<i>And I know that I have to go away</i>

02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:03.188
<i>I know I have to go</i>

02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:43.429
You know, it's a shame...

02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:47.957
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:51.317
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.035
I'm in.

02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:54.070
Dope.

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:56.310
I miss you guys so much!

02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:57.674
Hell, yes.

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.711
What say we steal some shit?

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.797
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:28.152
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.798
When they see
what I have created here...

02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:37.916
their wrath will dissipate.

02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:42.192
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:44.794
That, my child...

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.797
is the next step in our evolution.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.151
More powerful, more beautiful...

02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:54.359
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:59.474
I think I shall call him...

02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:02.719
Adam.

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:06.153
Ugh, dude.

02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.712
Seriously?

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:10.880
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:12.359
I am Groot.

02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:14.471
I am not boring. You're boring.

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:15.470
You know what's boring?

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:18.791
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.555
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.308
I'm not boring!

02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.480
I am Groot.

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:29.628
And now I know how Yondu felt.

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.675
In these times of hardship...

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:10.836
just remember...

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:15.519
We. Are. Groot.

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:19.994
Hey, fellas.

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.832
Wait, where are you going?

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.355
You were supposed to be my lift home.

02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:26.192
How will I get out of here?

02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:27.679
Hey! Aw, gee...

02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:30.479
I've got so many more stories to tell.

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:31.874
Aw, guys.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.349
Oh, gee...
