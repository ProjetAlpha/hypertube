WEBVTT

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:21.367
Ooh! Boom!

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.367
Ooh!

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.501
Ah, look at.

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:28.567
Oh!

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.367
I am the master boy.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.601
Superman punch, bitch! Yeah!

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:38.801
Hey!

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.133
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Get out!

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.133
You all right, brother?

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:14.334
Ooh, you see his bag fall?

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:18.033
It's what they call dramatic effect.

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:21.067
This is gonna get so many views.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.334
That a raccoon again?

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:26.100
Did you leave the door open, T?

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.501
I closed it.

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:29.367
Hello?

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:35.367
Yo, who's there?

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.534
We about to Salt Bae your ass.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.534
Superman-punch him, Ronald.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.033
Oh, shit.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:15.000
It's you.

00:02:56.434 --> 00:02:59.300
They bumped into me at the subway.

00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:01.434
Can't just let 'em go, Joseph.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:04.467
Weren't you on a specified walk?

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:07.167
You can't run this like the store.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.767
It's potluck.

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.734
All things come second
when we're on a specified walk.

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:15.267
The store works 'cause we have rules.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.367
Hey, it was a good follow, though.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.400
"We gonna Salt Bae your ass."
What a douche.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:24.100
It's definitely going into the book.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.100
"Salt Bae your ass."

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:30.100
What is that, anyway?

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:31.601
It's an Internet guy.

00:03:31.634 --> 00:03:35.701
He's a butcher who salts
his meat in an elaborate way.

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:38.334
You got dinged.

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.534
Good news, they're not calling you

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:45.400
the Tiptoe Man or the Float anymore.

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:49.100
They pretty much settled on
the Overseer.

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.100
It's cool.

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:54.534
Do not mention
the Tiptoe Man ever again.

00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:00.000
That's all he does? He seasons meat?

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:02.667
Dad, you look tired.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:06.033
Why don't we save the next walk
for the day after tomorrow?

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:11.000
When we find this Horde,
I'll take a mental health day.

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.234
Okay. Fine.

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:16.334
I have a new tenuous theory.

00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:18.701
Let's call it Tenuous Theory Number Two.

00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:21.300
The first set of girls
that were found mutilated

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:23.267
at the zoo three weeks ago
happened here.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.801
The second set, here.

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:26.367
Now, these new girls that went missing

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.367
create kind of a messy triangle,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.267
and where you were waiting
today at the subway

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.467
was in the middle of this triangle.

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.634
In Tenuous Theory Number Two,
he isn't in this triangle.

00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:38.400
He's coming from a place
that has easy access

00:04:38.434 --> 00:04:40.200
to this triangular feeding zone.

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:42.200
I think he's somewhere here, Dad,

00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:44.434
- in the factory area.
- Okay.

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:47.501
I'll walk around there tomorrow.

00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:49.167
Hey, Dad?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.400
I'm checking the police scanners.

00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:54.367
They're looking for you
pretty aggressively.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.100
Be real careful.

00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:58.033
All right.

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:23.634
Philadelphia has a new tallest building.

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:26.601
The Osaka Tower is taking over
the city skyline.

00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:29.501
The architecture makes it
an amazing sight to see.

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:32.367
And on top of that, it's
the ultimate in sustainability.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.567
It gets its power from solar panels.

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.400
Developers say it will
draw jobs to the city

00:05:36.434 --> 00:05:38.501
by the thousands...

00:05:57.534 --> 00:06:00.334
Audrey, I have to tell you something.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.667
Audrey.

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:31.367
Miss Patricia said that I'm not allowed

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.701
to play with you guys,
so don't even ask.

00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:36.634
I had a girlfriend once.

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:38.567
You don't know her.

00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:39.767
We kissed.

00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:41.634
It's no big deal.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.400
Stop messing with us.

00:06:43.434 --> 00:06:44.601
What do you want?

00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:46.234
Vera, don't get him angry.

00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:48.801
- He's sick.
- Don't tell me names.

00:06:48.834 --> 00:06:51.033
They said not to ask you your names,

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:55.801
because I might get sad,
you know, after tonight.

00:06:55.834 --> 00:06:57.767
Why did you pick us, Hedwig?

00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:00.067
Oh, uh, because you're impure

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.434
and you haven't done any suffering.

00:07:07.634 --> 00:07:09.100
You know that boy band stuff?

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.133
It's... some of it's okay, but Drake?

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:13.501
Drake's my new main man.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.534
The Beast is gonna come for you guys

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:21.100
any minute now, and I...

00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:24.534
I get... I get to greet him.

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:29.267
It's my big reward for keeping
the Horde in the light.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.567
I get to take him
to the masses of the broken.

00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:34.767
I better go.

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:39.234
He can come at any second

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:40.534
and I don't want him coming

00:07:40.567 --> 00:07:43.501
and finding roller skates on his feet.

00:07:43.534 --> 00:07:48.367
Miss Patricia would find out,
and she'd get angry, et cetera.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.567
- Thank you for coming in.
- Yep, thanks.

00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:58.301
- This is an outdoor dome infrared.
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:58.334 --> 00:08:00.600
We can use as many as you want
in the apartment building.

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:02.567
And people are on edge.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.500
- They just want to feel safe.
- Totally get it.

00:08:04.533 --> 00:08:06.067
I'm gonna take a walk.

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:09.201
Yeah, I don't think that you
need to take a walk today, Dad.

00:08:09.234 --> 00:08:11.167
Maybe tomorrow or the next day.

00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:14.001
No, I think I'm gonna take a walk now.

00:08:15.634 --> 00:08:18.034
Uh, you don't want
to take a lot of walks.

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:20.700
You might get tired.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:23.433
Let your dad take a walk. Jesus.

00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:24.867
Yeah.

00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:27.800
Hey, do I know you?

00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:31.467
Did you used to work
at the football stadium?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.600
15 years.

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:35.767
I used to hang out with some shady types

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.767
down at the stadium in my youth.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.867
Turned it around with positive thinking.

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:45.800
Should I ring this up?

00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:47.667
We're gonna have to close early.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.901
Yeah.

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.634
I missed him.

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:52.200
I'll come back tomorrow
when the factories are let out.

00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:56.434
Can come back to the store
and we could do some inventory.

00:09:56.467 --> 00:09:57.867
Okay.

00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:00.701
I'll see you back at the store.

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:09.934
You guys like cartoons?

00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:11.867
So babyish.

00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:13.333
I don't.

00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:14.867
I like documentaries.

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:16.567
You watch documentaries?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.734
I watched a documentary
about, um, space.

00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:22.600
It's real big.

00:10:22.634 --> 00:10:24.600
Sorry, bro.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.300
It's him. I saw a room.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.400
It had red clay, piles of it.

00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:37.934
It's some kind of factory.

00:10:37.967 --> 00:10:39.300
They're all in there.

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:40.801
All right, stand by.

00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:42.367
I'll search the area.

00:10:46.734 --> 00:10:49.267
Dad, I found a brick factory.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.934
Uh, it's old, abandoned.

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:53.534
- Which direction?
- To the south.

00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:57.434
Dad?

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.267
Dad?

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.701
You said I could have some.

00:11:15.734 --> 00:11:17.634
I know.

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:20.233
Taking everything for yourself.

00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:21.500
Take some.

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:28.567
Hey. I...

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.967
Oh, my God.

00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:36.701
You said I could have some.

00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:38.667
I know.

00:11:44.867 --> 00:11:46.600
What?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.600
Huh?

00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:54.767
Taking everything for yourself.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.634
I don't... know...

00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:18.300
Who are you?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.434
I...

00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:25.267
am you.

00:13:10.534 --> 00:13:11.767
Come on!

00:13:15.801 --> 00:13:18.467
Come on!

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.200
Where did it go?

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:45.867
Leave!

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.634
Don't, don't. Don't shoot!

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:44.300
We can work through this.

00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:46.001
Just put the guns away. I...

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.734
What's happening?

00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:50.300
I didn't do anything.

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:51.934
My name is Barry.

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:53.434
All right?

00:16:53.467 --> 00:16:56.500
We have to get Kevin
to stay in the light.

00:16:56.534 --> 00:16:58.534
Just-just don't shoot us.

00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:00.367
Don't shoot.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.300
He won't hurt anyone now.

00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:07.567
You may find your way out of here,

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.834
but you will have to hurt
a lot of officers.

00:17:09.867 --> 00:17:11.500
A lot of people.

00:17:11.534 --> 00:17:14.734
No one needs to get hurt anymore, David.

00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:29.701
It's gonna be okay, Joseph.

00:17:29.734 --> 00:17:30.934
Take them straight to

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:34.333
Raven Hill Memorial, the West
Wing of Raven Hill Memorial.

00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:40.400
Grab that poncho!

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:56.801
No trouble.

00:18:10.967 --> 00:18:13.267
Keep moving.

00:18:14.001 --> 00:18:15.901
Keep moving.

00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:17.367
Please, don't. Don't.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.534
- Don't. No.
- Easy. Easy.

00:18:18.567 --> 00:18:20.367
Hey. Hey! Hey!

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.001
We're cool, we're cool. Totally cool.

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.599
All right?
He doesn't like to be touched.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.400
I can, I can walk.
I'll just, I'll... walk.

00:18:26.434 --> 00:18:28.267
Keep walking.

00:18:57.067 --> 00:19:00.933
My name is Dr. Ellie Staple,
and I'm a psychiatrist.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.034
This room must look nefarious.

00:19:05.067 --> 00:19:08.900
The walls are equipped with
46 high-pressured nozzles,

00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:11.034
all connected to a 15,000-gallon

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.234
water tank outside.

00:19:13.267 --> 00:19:15.301
It will only be triggered
if you are threatening

00:19:15.334 --> 00:19:17.467
or trying to escape.

00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:19.800
This is a hypnosis light...

00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:23.833
Dennis.

00:19:23.867 --> 00:19:26.900
My pleasure, Dennis.

00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:29.034
You are being monitored.

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.932
If, for some reason,
there's a threatening identity

00:19:30.933 --> 00:19:32.900
in the room, the light
will automatically strobe

00:19:32.933 --> 00:19:35.434
and force a different identity
to take over.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:36.900
Who was the man?

00:19:36.933 --> 00:19:40.167
He was as strong as The Beast.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.900
The man people in this city
have been talking about.

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:45.467
The only person
to survive that train wreck

00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:47.334
all those years ago.

00:19:47.367 --> 00:19:50.034
I saw a video of you fighting

00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:52.367
near a fire hydrant that erupted.

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:53.900
Saw you choke.

00:19:53.933 --> 00:19:56.567
I think you believe
water is your weakness.

00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:58.034
Where are you keeping him?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.301
<i>Everyone is safe, David.</i>

00:20:13.334 --> 00:20:19.301
Maybe this will all make sense
if I explain who I am.

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:24.000
I specialize in a particular
type of delusion of grandeur.

00:20:24.034 --> 00:20:26.900
I specialize in those individuals

00:20:26.933 --> 00:20:29.833
who believe they are superheroes.

00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:31.833
I've been given three days

00:20:31.867 --> 00:20:34.933
to treat you
by whatever means necessary.

00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:40.301
I came here for you both.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.267
<i>Yo, this doctor comes in here,</i>

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:10.900
takes over our wing,
tells us all new rules.

00:21:10.933 --> 00:21:13.334
Rules of conduct.

00:21:13.367 --> 00:21:17.000
How to treat people with kindness.

00:21:17.034 --> 00:21:19.434
My whole life, all I do
is take care of people.

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:22.967
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. There you go.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.200
We got along just fine
without her, didn't we?

00:21:25.234 --> 00:21:26.534
Me and you?

00:21:28.567 --> 00:21:31.434
Anyway...

00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:34.434
you won't be lonely anymore.

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:37.000
You have two new friends.

00:21:56.401 --> 00:21:59.867
Casey, could I see you for a second?

00:22:07.334 --> 00:22:09.967
<i>I received a call
from your foster family.</i>

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.301
Apparently, it's on the news.

00:22:13.334 --> 00:22:16.067
They caught the guy who abducted you

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.833
and murdered all those girls.

00:22:18.867 --> 00:22:20.567
They caught the bastard.

00:22:20.601 --> 00:22:23.100
Your foster family is thrilled.

00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:27.167
I can imagine how much relief
this causes you.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.933
I'm sure you've been thinking about him.

00:22:32.334 --> 00:22:35.800
I... have been thinking about him.

00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:56.900
They, uh, told me to bring
lots of options.

00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:01.800
Hey, cutie.

00:23:03.501 --> 00:23:05.867
Think you could help me?

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.334
I'm Jade.

00:23:07.367 --> 00:23:10.434
They gave me a syringe for
my diabetes, but I dropped it.

00:23:10.467 --> 00:23:11.534
My hands get...

00:23:11.567 --> 00:23:12.766
It's a little too close to the light.

00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:16.267
Do you think you could
pick it up for me?

00:23:30.134 --> 00:23:33.201
Wow.

00:23:33.234 --> 00:23:34.767
Stand up.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.900
Let me get a good look at you.

00:23:43.767 --> 00:23:46.101
You are so tall.

00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:50.367
Orwell and Barry are so angry
with me that I flipped.

00:23:50.401 --> 00:23:53.034
But the truth is

00:23:53.067 --> 00:23:57.101
we really can do things
that you can't do.

00:23:57.134 --> 00:24:00.000
I don't understand.

00:24:12.834 --> 00:24:15.301
Hey. Hey. Hey!

00:24:17.401 --> 00:24:19.967
I'm Ian.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.067
- All right?
- I'm Ian.

00:24:23.101 --> 00:24:26.000
And I'm Mary Reynolds.
We're twins.

00:24:26.034 --> 00:24:27.934
Do you know what would have happened

00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:30.367
if she'd have gotten
to that key, you gobshite?

00:24:30.401 --> 00:24:32.134
The Horde would have killed ya.

00:24:32.167 --> 00:24:33.700
What've you got?

00:24:33.733 --> 00:24:36.267
You get a little,
get a little hard-on? Daryl.

00:24:36.301 --> 00:24:38.667
Just calm down, okay?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.401
I'm sorry for being with the Horde.

00:24:43.434 --> 00:24:45.401
It's just, it's just...

00:24:45.434 --> 00:24:48.034
Oh, do you know,
I am tired of being sorry.

00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:50.000
You can call me Norma.

00:24:50.034 --> 00:24:52.234
I am sorry about the whole lying thing.

00:24:52.267 --> 00:24:54.367
- Though I'm not lying.
- Bro, just stop talking!

00:24:55.733 --> 00:24:58.000
I was so amped!

00:24:58.034 --> 00:25:00.633
We almost got you, bro!

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:02.733
Trying to keep him here
with this light thing?

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:05.967
- That's some buttery shit!
- Stop talking.

00:25:07.267 --> 00:25:09.700
I'm not supposed to be in the light.

00:25:09.733 --> 00:25:11.800
Uh, we need more time.

00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:13.633
Barry is speaking to Kevin,

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:15.201
trying to get him near the light.

00:25:15.234 --> 00:25:16.867
Is he close enough yet?

00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:23.234
The only one who can defend us is him!

00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:24.700
Him!

00:25:39.134 --> 00:25:42.267
Where is the man in the rain poncho?

00:25:42.301 --> 00:25:45.700
Who is he?

00:25:45.733 --> 00:25:49.667
Is he just a regular man?
I need to know.

00:25:51.334 --> 00:25:54.700
All right, step away from
the controls now, little duck.

00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:57.600
That's fine. Now just walk away.

00:26:05.034 --> 00:26:08.167
That's it.

00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:10.134
Just tiptoe away.

00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:15.367
I try to come once every week.

00:26:15.401 --> 00:26:17.034
Sometimes, I admit,

00:26:17.067 --> 00:26:19.700
I have neglected a week here and there.

00:26:19.733 --> 00:26:24.101
He's changed over the years.

00:26:24.134 --> 00:26:27.234
I can tell he's given up.

00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:30.234
It's hard to see.

00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:33.101
He thinks he was a mistake.

00:26:33.134 --> 00:26:35.667
I'm not saying he did good things.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.101
He didn't.

00:26:37.134 --> 00:26:40.733
Those poor people didn't
deserve to die like that.

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:46.767
But he's trying
to make sense of who he is.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.867
Ain't we all doing that?

00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:51.900
Yes, ma'am, we are.

00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:58.100
He has this notion

00:26:58.133 --> 00:27:02.133
that superheroes are
based on people like him,

00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:06.234
and that other gentleman
I read is here, Mr. Dunn.

00:27:06.267 --> 00:27:08.234
Would it surprise you to know

00:27:08.267 --> 00:27:12.400
there are more and more people
who have this delusion?

00:27:12.434 --> 00:27:16.133
It is actually the center of my work.

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:19.467
Yes, it would.

00:27:23.501 --> 00:27:26.601
You don't let them get you down, Elijah.

00:27:27.801 --> 00:27:30.100
You hear me?

00:27:30.801 --> 00:27:32.767
Stay proud.

00:27:32.801 --> 00:27:36.100
♪ As I do

00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:40.367
♪ I never dreamed that skies... ♪

00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:43.601
Step back against the wall, please.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.501
You're keeping him here without guards?

00:28:48.534 --> 00:28:51.234
I have to get out of here
before he gets out.

00:28:51.267 --> 00:28:54.601
The individual
who came with you is contained.

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.367
David.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.367
I would like you to agree
to have an MRI.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.760
You were the sole survivor of
a devastating train derailment

00:29:04.767 --> 00:29:06.200
19 years ago.

00:29:06.234 --> 00:29:08.367
It is possible that there was

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.200
damage to the frontal lobe
that you are unaware of.

00:29:27.801 --> 00:29:29.434
Look at you, David.

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:32.434
You believe you have barely
enough strength to stand up.

00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:35.300
You can't possibly
explain everything away.

00:29:42.133 --> 00:29:45.100
Madam, I am Mr. Pritchard.

00:29:45.133 --> 00:29:47.234
I'm a professor of cinema.

00:29:47.267 --> 00:29:50.067
Specifically, Japanese,
1950s through the 1980s.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.100
And I have absolutely no idea
what I'm doing here.

00:29:53.133 --> 00:29:55.234
I am very much in favor
of Kevin's reemergence,

00:29:55.267 --> 00:29:58.234
and yet I find myself
in a goddamn prison cell!

00:29:58.267 --> 00:30:00.367
And I can assure you I am not...

00:30:04.234 --> 00:30:06.334
Okay.

00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:29.501
I'm ready.

00:30:30.834 --> 00:30:34.133
Young man, wait!

00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:36.734
You will not be able
to get to the light.

00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:39.734
It is set off by distance

00:30:39.767 --> 00:30:42.034
as well as being monitored by a camera.

00:30:42.067 --> 00:30:45.167
I know this seems very unfair to you...

00:30:45.201 --> 00:30:48.567
...but you are stuck in this room.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.067
The guy The Beast fought,
he's right there!

00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:54.067
He can't beat The Beast.

00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:57.634
He doesn't think he can
beat The Beast, does he? Huh?

00:30:57.667 --> 00:30:59.034
Beast like...

00:31:03.934 --> 00:31:07.767
He doesn't think he can
beat The Beast, does he?

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.134
Beast like...

00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:13.967
Your name is Hedwig, right?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.401
You're nine, right?

00:31:16.434 --> 00:31:18.234
Yeah.

00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:20.067
Forever?

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:25.334
No matter how many experiences you have?

00:31:28.634 --> 00:31:30.933
That must be so hard.

00:31:33.067 --> 00:31:34.434
You treat people who think

00:31:34.467 --> 00:31:36.933
they're comic book characters
or something?

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.301
I got to go.

00:31:45.334 --> 00:31:48.200
Miss Patricia says she wants the light.

00:32:00.467 --> 00:32:02.900
Hello, Patricia.

00:32:02.933 --> 00:32:06.067
- I'm Dr. Staple.
- I've gathered.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.034
As I understand it, you're
kind of the high priestess.

00:32:11.067 --> 00:32:14.401
This cause isn't about me.

00:32:14.434 --> 00:32:16.501
It's about The Beast, is it?

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:18.100
Where is he?

00:32:18.134 --> 00:32:20.867
- Who?
- The man.

00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:24.900
He is guarded, isn't he?

00:32:24.933 --> 00:32:26.833
He can't get out?

00:32:38.301 --> 00:32:40.267
He's well-intentioned
and you would love him.

00:32:40.301 --> 00:32:43.967
He's, like, a huge,
he's a big trickster.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.067
He's a, he's a, he's a great guy.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.601
He's got a great sense of humor.

00:32:47.634 --> 00:32:51.601
- So, let me recap what you've told me.
- Mm-hmm.

00:32:51.634 --> 00:32:55.434
Your dad is not the Green Guard
or "whatever his name is."

00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:59.301
Your dad is a trickster,
and that I would love him.

00:32:59.334 --> 00:33:02.434
He thought it would be fun
to be a do-gooder for a day,

00:33:02.467 --> 00:33:03.967
pretend he was this guy.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.067
And with regard
to how he found the girls,

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.234
you retold a humorous story
where your dad thought

00:33:08.267 --> 00:33:10.401
the killer might be in the factory area

00:33:10.434 --> 00:33:13.567
because his friend Lou...
you referred to him as Louie

00:33:13.601 --> 00:33:16.167
at a different point...
got mugged down there once.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.167
Then your father was
walking by a building,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.034
hears girls screaming for help,
at which point you spiritedly

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:25.401
reenacted this moment in the story.

00:33:25.434 --> 00:33:26.867
Thank you for that.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.034
Then your father called you on the cell.

00:33:30.067 --> 00:33:32.334
You told him to call
the police, but he was,

00:33:32.367 --> 00:33:34.833
"In it, you know. In it."

00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:36.234
Right.

00:33:36.267 --> 00:33:38.967
I'll sign that in front of a judge.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.100
So, you see, he shouldn't be here.

00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:45.967
How long have you believed
your dad was a superhero?

00:33:47.933 --> 00:33:49.900
There was a microphone on his poncho.

00:33:49.933 --> 00:33:52.167
I assume he was communicating with you.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.434
He talks to you
when he's out on searches,

00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:56.967
doesn't he, Joseph?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.067
He hasn't hurt anybody.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.534
In the eyes of the authorities,
that is not accurate.

00:34:02.567 --> 00:34:04.134
He's injured countless individuals

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:06.401
who haven't had
their due process in court.

00:34:06.434 --> 00:34:08.967
And there was a teenage girl
in this latest incident

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.534
- who broke her arm and ribs.
- No.

00:34:10.567 --> 00:34:11.933
They would all be murder victims

00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:13.367
if it wasn't for my dad.

00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:16.200
It was a vigilante event,
and a victim was injured.

00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:19.100
They will claim, in court, that
if they had found the girls,

00:34:19.134 --> 00:34:22.534
no one would have been hurt.

00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:25.534
Joseph, I only have a few days.

00:34:25.567 --> 00:34:28.567
If I don't get him to give up
his delusion, he will remain

00:34:28.601 --> 00:34:32.967
in institutions like this
for the rest of his life.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.967
No, he can't stay here.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.367
Can I ask you about your mother, Joseph?

00:34:38.401 --> 00:34:40.501
What does that have to do with this?

00:34:40.534 --> 00:34:44.567
She passed away from
acute lymphoblastic leukemia

00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:46.601
five years ago.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.367
That was cataclysmic
for you and your dad.

00:34:53.401 --> 00:34:56.134
Yeah.

00:34:56.167 --> 00:34:58.967
On the surface, Joseph, you can see

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.933
what I'm going to say, right?

00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:04.067
You lost your mother.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.100
You believe your father
is a real-life superhero.

00:35:07.134 --> 00:35:09.501
You believe he is almost immortal.

00:35:09.534 --> 00:35:14.034
You can see how some would say
you need this to be true.

00:35:15.933 --> 00:35:17.301
You just have to make sure

00:35:17.334 --> 00:35:20.601
you are not more into this than he is.

00:35:37.634 --> 00:35:39.600
Joseph.

00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:43.734
There are big guys in almost every gym

00:35:43.767 --> 00:35:45.333
that can lift that much.

00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:49.300
You could've lifted more.

00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:52.434
Don't worry.

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:55.333
I won't tell anyone.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.567
<i>Just because he let you go</i>

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.800
<i>doesn't mean he is good.</i>

00:36:38.834 --> 00:36:41.767
He's being held here before his trial.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.834
I'm in charge of him for now,

00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:48.433
but everyone in this state
wants him tried and put away.

00:36:50.167 --> 00:36:51.901
I'm trying to get the others

00:36:51.934 --> 00:36:56.433
to stop thinking of this
as a superhuman being.

00:36:56.467 --> 00:36:58.700
If they do, they will do the right thing

00:36:58.734 --> 00:37:01.001
and keep him from the light.

00:37:04.533 --> 00:37:06.800
Can I talk with them?

00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:10.034
Why?

00:37:10.067 --> 00:37:12.001
Because it's not...

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.001
You're the victim.

00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:48.167
No way!

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:51.600
You tried so hard to get away from us

00:37:51.634 --> 00:37:53.600
and now you come back and see us?

00:37:53.634 --> 00:37:56.134
You are so weird.

00:37:56.167 --> 00:37:57.967
I like Drake now.

00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:01.134
I liked Nicki for a while, but
then Nicki and Drake broke up,

00:38:01.167 --> 00:38:03.600
and you can't like both.

00:38:03.634 --> 00:38:05.500
This place is for people who think

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:07.467
that they're comic book characters.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.800
And the Horde is kind of like

00:38:08.834 --> 00:38:10.967
a comic book character name, isn't it?

00:38:15.533 --> 00:38:18.800
Love comic books.

00:38:18.834 --> 00:38:23.167
I'm sorry for trying to feed
you to The Beast, et cetera.

00:38:23.201 --> 00:38:26.901
It's okay.

00:38:26.934 --> 00:38:29.433
Can I talk to Dennis
or Patricia, please?

00:38:29.467 --> 00:38:31.967
She was my girlfriend.

00:38:32.001 --> 00:38:33.867
We kissed.

00:38:35.533 --> 00:38:37.901
Don't worry. I haven't cheated on you.

00:38:44.533 --> 00:38:46.667
What are you doing here?

00:38:49.533 --> 00:38:51.800
Your clothes are not dirty.

00:38:51.834 --> 00:38:54.034
Good.

00:38:54.067 --> 00:38:56.500
Hello, Dennis.

00:38:58.201 --> 00:39:01.034
A lot of people have died.

00:39:01.067 --> 00:39:04.500
Well...

00:39:04.533 --> 00:39:08.533
You have to give up the light.

00:39:08.567 --> 00:39:10.533
They're never gonna let you out of here.

00:39:10.567 --> 00:39:13.667
The Horde has to give up the light.

00:39:15.567 --> 00:39:18.967
Listen to this doctor.

00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:22.767
The doc tells lies.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.500
We will reveal that the broken
are the strongest.

00:39:26.533 --> 00:39:28.533
The Beast will start a revolution.

00:39:28.567 --> 00:39:30.167
Is that what Patricia told you to say?

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:33.901
The Beast is the highest form
of human evolution.

00:39:33.934 --> 00:39:36.667
Dennis. You guys are gonna die.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.533
Casey.

00:39:40.167 --> 00:39:43.134
Ah... oh...

00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:45.101
Oh, sh...

00:39:57.934 --> 00:40:00.533
Hey.

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.834
Kevin?

00:40:04.867 --> 00:40:06.800
It's you.

00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:19.500
You look different.

00:40:19.533 --> 00:40:22.967
I wanted to tell you something.

00:40:23.001 --> 00:40:26.101
My uncle's in jail.

00:40:26.134 --> 00:40:28.433
I put him there.

00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:35.533
What he did to me was... wrong.

00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:39.567
Just like what your mom
did to you was wrong.

00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:42.834
We're the same?

00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:52.800
I'm sorry.

00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:54.667
- I can't. I got...
- Kevin, wait.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.967
I've got to go. I've got to go.

00:40:58.001 --> 00:41:02.767
The Horde is never
letting go of the light and...

00:41:06.934 --> 00:41:10.500
Do you like Kevin now?

00:41:10.533 --> 00:41:13.634
Casey. I need you.

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:16.600
The power of true,
loving, physical affection,

00:41:16.634 --> 00:41:18.667
it's like something supernatural.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.800
It's the lack of it that caused this,

00:41:20.834 --> 00:41:23.567
and only the true version of it
can heal it.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.967
Will you help me?

00:41:53.167 --> 00:41:56.934
<i>You are the last
person I need to see today.</i>

00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:00.734
You see this camera?

00:42:00.767 --> 00:42:03.934
There are 100 more of these.

00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:06.034
Out of respect for
your cognitive abilities,

00:42:06.067 --> 00:42:09.767
I have installed cameras
on every floor, every area,

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.600
including every direction
of the exterior building.

00:42:12.634 --> 00:42:14.634
We will see everything.

00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:18.500
There is nowhere you can go
that won't be documented.

00:42:18.533 --> 00:42:21.901
Elijah. I've come to the conclusion

00:42:21.934 --> 00:42:25.567
that we should perform
a procedure on you.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.634
This is a corrective procedure
that rebalances

00:42:28.667 --> 00:42:32.201
the part of the frontal lobe
that is overstimulated.

00:42:32.234 --> 00:42:36.001
It would be an honor to get to
know your perspicacious mind.

00:42:36.034 --> 00:42:40.500
We're going to conduct
the procedure in three days.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.067
12!

00:42:58.934 --> 00:43:00.634
Keep going!

00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:08.634
Right there, right there!

00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:24.500
♪ We had a future

00:43:24.533 --> 00:43:28.667
♪ The sun was shining

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.167
♪ And then you told me...

00:43:32.201 --> 00:43:35.533
Hey, my man.

00:43:35.567 --> 00:43:37.700
How'd you get out of your room?

00:43:37.734 --> 00:43:39.967
You must have left the door ajar.

00:43:40.001 --> 00:43:41.967
He rolled out toward the noise.

00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:45.034
Wheel him back in
before the doctor sees.

00:43:45.067 --> 00:43:47.201
Oh, you're too nice, Daryl.

00:43:47.234 --> 00:43:48.901
You got to be firm.

00:43:48.934 --> 00:43:51.867
They'll walk all over you otherwise.

00:43:51.901 --> 00:43:55.101
He didn't touch
any of the medicines, did he?

00:43:55.134 --> 00:43:57.767
No.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.767
Right amounts.

00:44:12.533 --> 00:44:16.667
♪ We had a future

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.901
♪ The sun was shining

00:44:20.934 --> 00:44:25.533
♪ And then you told me...

00:44:27.101 --> 00:44:30.034
<i>This will be my final evaluation.</i>

00:44:38.734 --> 00:44:41.834
You got to be kidding me.

00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:44.600
This guy killed everyone on my train.

00:44:44.634 --> 00:44:47.600
He's a mass murderer.

00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:01.934
I understand that the three of you

00:45:01.967 --> 00:45:04.500
think you are superhuman.

00:45:04.533 --> 00:45:06.667
That you don't think you are normal.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.934
You've convinced yourselves
you have extraordinary gifts,

00:45:10.967 --> 00:45:14.500
like something out of a comic book.

00:45:14.533 --> 00:45:17.134
I am here to discuss the possibility

00:45:17.167 --> 00:45:19.901
that you are mistaken.

00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:23.400
Can you tell me about Kevin's parents?

00:45:27.067 --> 00:45:30.134
Kevin's mother...

00:45:30.167 --> 00:45:32.700
hurt Kevin.

00:45:32.734 --> 00:45:36.901
And Kevin's father
was gonna get a doctor

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:40.867
to try and stop her, but he left.

00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:47.667
I never wanted any of this.

00:45:49.167 --> 00:45:51.433
What?

00:45:51.467 --> 00:45:52.967
The killings.

00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:12.901
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

00:46:15.201 --> 00:46:18.934
- Kevin Wendell Crumb.
- Kevin Wendell Crumb!

00:46:20.901 --> 00:46:22.667
What did I tell you?!

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.734
There is no running in the house,

00:46:24.767 --> 00:46:26.934
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

00:46:28.234 --> 00:46:30.767
Kevin?

00:46:33.134 --> 00:46:35.067
Kevin.

00:46:35.101 --> 00:46:37.634
Why do you all keep bringing me back?

00:46:37.667 --> 00:46:39.600
I-I don't want to be here.

00:46:39.634 --> 00:46:42.834
The need for the particular
story we tell ourselves

00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:44.201
begins somewhere, Kevin.

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.201
From a memory.

00:46:46.234 --> 00:46:49.134
What?

00:46:49.167 --> 00:46:50.600
I don't...

00:46:50.634 --> 00:46:53.834
Hey, where's that girl?

00:46:53.867 --> 00:46:55.934
Casey. Sh-She...

00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:00.767
Everybody wants the light now.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.767
They're all fighting, et cetera.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.567
And Miss Patricia's yelling at me,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.201
saying I got to hold on to the light.

00:47:06.234 --> 00:47:10.001
She said I have one job to do:
keep Kevin out of the light.

00:47:10.034 --> 00:47:12.167
So, I'm sorry,
you won't see him anymore.

00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:17.467
And you have to listen to her, right?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.901
Because she's an adult and you're not.

00:47:19.934 --> 00:47:23.001
Duh. Yeah.

00:47:23.034 --> 00:47:24.767
Is he crying?

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.767
Geez, pussy.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.934
Listen, I don't know about
these other guys,

00:47:29.967 --> 00:47:31.634
but we are like a superhero.

00:47:31.667 --> 00:47:34.101
No? We're like...

00:47:34.134 --> 00:47:35.967
We're not crazy!

00:47:37.867 --> 00:47:42.967
David, I don't think
this applies just to Kevin

00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.134
and his disorder.

00:47:45.167 --> 00:47:47.167
Is there a memory?

00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:49.500
What you're looking for

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:51.767
is a moment of weakness that made you

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:55.800
possibly entertain the idea
of being super strong.

00:48:27.234 --> 00:48:30.800
There is a reason I ask you.

00:48:34.101 --> 00:48:36.400
This is your MRI, David.

00:48:40.967 --> 00:48:44.001
This is your frontal lobe.

00:48:44.034 --> 00:48:47.934
There is a questionable cloud
right here.

00:48:47.967 --> 00:48:50.533
There is the possibility

00:48:50.567 --> 00:48:53.433
that that is damage
from that train accident.

00:48:53.467 --> 00:48:56.934
I'm supposed to believe
this means something?

00:49:01.934 --> 00:49:04.867
It's just this,
plus an anchoring incident,

00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:09.034
and you would have the pattern
for this disorder that I treat.

00:49:20.533 --> 00:49:23.500
I hate to see you like this.

00:49:23.533 --> 00:49:25.567
This is not how I would've done things.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.634
I don't approve of
how they've handled you.

00:49:29.667 --> 00:49:31.634
Elijah, because of your condition,

00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:34.001
I didn't have to do an MRI on you.

00:49:34.034 --> 00:49:36.167
There are a few in your file.

00:49:36.201 --> 00:49:38.167
You definitely have one of the markers

00:49:38.201 --> 00:49:40.034
for this disorder, Elijah.

00:49:40.067 --> 00:49:41.767
As do you, Kevin.

00:49:44.067 --> 00:49:45.834
These are the medical reasons

00:49:45.867 --> 00:49:48.600
I'm thinking you have this disorder.

00:49:48.634 --> 00:49:51.533
Now let's deal with
why you think you don't.

00:49:51.567 --> 00:49:57.433
How do you know who's good
and who's bad, David?

00:49:57.467 --> 00:49:59.567
Convince me.

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:04.767
It's a feeling.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.201
An intuition?

00:50:06.234 --> 00:50:09.167
When you see someone?

00:50:09.201 --> 00:50:11.101
I have to touch them.

00:50:11.134 --> 00:50:14.001
What does the intuition feel like?

00:50:16.067 --> 00:50:18.934
A vision.

00:50:18.967 --> 00:50:21.101
A moment.

00:50:21.134 --> 00:50:23.567
A sin.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.834
You kind of have to interpret it.

00:50:26.867 --> 00:50:29.500
Have you ever seen
very good magicians, David?

00:50:29.533 --> 00:50:32.767
I mean, the very best.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.667
They are trained as mentalists,

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.101
and they can do
seemingly extraordinary feats.

00:50:38.134 --> 00:50:41.034
They accomplish these feats by
interpreting hundreds of cues

00:50:41.067 --> 00:50:44.901
that an individual is
giving off in a split second.

00:50:44.934 --> 00:50:49.800
I think you are like these
professional guessers, David.

00:50:49.834 --> 00:50:54.767
You are world-class at it,
simply extraordinary at it.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:00.201
But it is based on real things,
and you are making the picture.

00:51:00.234 --> 00:51:03.734
It is not coming to you
through mystical means.

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:13.067
These are the clothes
that the patient next to you

00:51:13.101 --> 00:51:14.901
came in with when he arrived.

00:51:14.934 --> 00:51:18.034
There's red clay staining the pants.

00:51:18.067 --> 00:51:20.634
It's very visible.

00:51:23.967 --> 00:51:27.934
Is it possible that you saw
something on the news...

00:51:27.967 --> 00:51:31.001
- Sorry, bro.
<i>- ...then saw an adult acting like a child,</i>

00:51:31.034 --> 00:51:35.034
someone who fit the bill
of someone with this disorder,

00:51:35.067 --> 00:51:38.433
intuited, "This might be
the person I'm looking for"?

00:51:38.467 --> 00:51:39.634
Saw the red clay

00:51:39.667 --> 00:51:45.001
and thought he might be hiding
in a place with red clay?

00:51:45.034 --> 00:51:47.001
No.

00:51:47.034 --> 00:51:49.667
You're certain?

00:51:51.234 --> 00:51:55.700
You're... creating a chain of
thoughts that never happened.

00:52:03.533 --> 00:52:06.767
You really dissected him, Doctor.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.134
Good for you.

00:52:09.167 --> 00:52:11.967
As I understand it,
there were many videos

00:52:12.001 --> 00:52:13.800
of world-class rock climbers

00:52:13.834 --> 00:52:16.567
on the computer
in your office at the zoo.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.901
It was kind of an obsession.

00:52:18.934 --> 00:52:20.834
Some of those climbers

00:52:20.867 --> 00:52:24.201
could actually scale
a literal wall, couldn't they?

00:52:26.533 --> 00:52:28.067
What's your point, Doctor?

00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:29.634
It was a practical observation

00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:32.901
that produced a practical
skill set in an alter.

00:52:32.934 --> 00:52:36.101
Mm.

00:52:36.134 --> 00:52:38.901
Then how did he bend the bars?

00:52:38.934 --> 00:52:41.600
The iron bars at the zoo?

00:52:41.634 --> 00:52:45.567
You did see those, didn't you?

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.134
That's not in our heads.

00:52:47.167 --> 00:52:48.734
The cages beneath the zoo

00:52:48.767 --> 00:52:51.901
were made in 1874
when the zoo first opened.

00:52:51.934 --> 00:52:55.600
I was able to bend them by
putting a wrench between them

00:52:55.634 --> 00:52:56.734
and leaning back.

00:52:56.767 --> 00:53:00.867
Difficult, again, but possible.

00:53:00.901 --> 00:53:02.834
No.

00:53:02.867 --> 00:53:04.634
What about the shotgun?

00:53:04.667 --> 00:53:06.767
He was shot. Not once but twice.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.767
What does your sleeping mind
think of that?

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.101
We've analyzed the shotgun
and the cartridges.

00:53:11.134 --> 00:53:12.700
They were very old.

00:53:12.734 --> 00:53:15.767
There was a lot of moisture
from the boiler room

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.533
down in the locker area
where they were kept.

00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:21.034
The cartridges were
possibly compromised.

00:53:21.067 --> 00:53:24.533
And some of the pellets
hit the inside of the bars.

00:53:27.034 --> 00:53:28.834
It is at least possible

00:53:28.867 --> 00:53:31.800
that there is a practical
explanation for this.

00:53:37.034 --> 00:53:40.934
What if I suggested
something upsetting, Patricia?

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.067
Like The Beast isn't
as powerful as you think.

00:53:47.101 --> 00:53:51.767
He's not much more powerful
than a strong man.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.500
The facts you are basing
your belief in are wrong.

00:53:58.067 --> 00:54:02.934
If superheroes exist, why are
there only three of you?

00:54:10.034 --> 00:54:12.667
<i>When was the first comic book written?</i>

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:17.001
The first reprints of newspaper
strips in tabloid size

00:54:17.034 --> 00:54:18.934
happened in 1929.

00:54:18.967 --> 00:54:23.767
And then, in 1938,
the apotheosis happened.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.034
Action Comics Number One launched

00:54:26.067 --> 00:54:29.634
with the man in the cape and
the blue tights on the cover.

00:54:29.667 --> 00:54:30.600
Boo-yah!

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:32.634
Here we are.

00:54:39.767 --> 00:54:41.700
Thank you.

00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:48.967
What are you doing back there?

00:54:49.001 --> 00:54:51.567
You're not one of those
Hello Kitty pervs?

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.967
I'm just looking for something.

00:54:56.034 --> 00:54:58.767
Prove to someone I'm not crazy.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.767
I'm leaving.

00:56:08.634 --> 00:56:10.500
Oh, my God.

00:57:07.533 --> 00:57:09.667
- Catch.
- You're it.

00:57:20.134 --> 00:57:22.734
- Let's play hot potato, guys.
- Let's play hot potato!

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.001
Hot potato. Hot potato.

00:57:28.034 --> 00:57:30.034
<i>Hot potato. Hot potato.</i>

00:57:30.067 --> 00:57:31.767
Hot potato. Hot potato. Hot potato.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.600
Hot potato! Hot potato! Hot!

00:57:33.634 --> 00:57:35.034
- You're out.
- You're out.

00:57:35.067 --> 00:57:36.034
Come on, ready?

00:57:36.067 --> 00:57:38.567
<i>- No!
- No!</i>

00:57:40.134 --> 00:57:45.734
Hot potato. Hot potato. Hot potato.

00:57:45.767 --> 00:57:47.533
Hot potato. Hot potato. Hot potato.

00:57:47.567 --> 00:57:49.067
Hot potato! Hot!

00:57:49.101 --> 00:57:51.700
I'm just asking you to bring in
a package if you see one

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:54.700
instead of stepping over it
to come in the house.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.734
Hello?

00:58:47.201 --> 00:58:51.167
If, by mistake, I-I drop this...

00:58:51.201 --> 00:58:54.634
heavy flashlight on your paper legs...

00:58:57.001 --> 00:58:59.600
...no one would come
check on you for some time,

00:58:59.634 --> 00:59:02.700
not until Daryl gets here for his shift.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.867
Have you been getting
out of your room, Elijah?

00:59:39.467 --> 00:59:42.567
I must be losing my mind.

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:10.600
Night, Joe.

01:00:10.634 --> 01:00:12.734
Have a good night.

01:00:17.533 --> 01:00:20.034
- Daryl.
- Hey, my man.

01:00:20.067 --> 01:00:21.634
You almost made it.

01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:24.901
I think your watch is fast.

01:00:24.934 --> 01:00:26.167
Joe, my man.

01:00:26.201 --> 01:00:27.667
- How's it going?
- What's going on?

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.133
- What's happening?
- Looking tired, man.

01:00:29.134 --> 01:00:30.499
You still taking that multivitamin?

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.400
Not like I should.

01:00:31.433 --> 01:00:33.500
Yeah, but, listen,
you got to take the D.

01:00:33.533 --> 01:00:34.599
If you don't take vitamin D,

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.767
none of that stuff's gonna
absorb into your body.

01:01:52.134 --> 01:01:55.101
Clarence Wendell Crumb.

01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:17.233
Take a little bit of grape seed extract,

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.634
and it'll keep it all in there.

01:02:18.667 --> 01:02:20.500
You'll absorb it into your body faster.

01:02:20.533 --> 01:02:22.233
Let me ask you,
how much water you drinking?

01:02:22.234 --> 01:02:25.500
- Not enough.
- Yeah. I know.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:52.901
How?

01:02:52.934 --> 01:02:57.600
How did you get here
without anyone seeing?

01:02:57.634 --> 01:02:59.767
The sound of a car backfiring occurs

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.034
when unburned fuel vapor is
ignited by a very hot muffler

01:03:03.067 --> 01:03:04.967
upon the car being turned off.

01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:06.967
Daryl, who takes over at 11:00 p.m.,

01:03:07.001 --> 01:03:09.500
suffers from this particular
vehicular malady.

01:03:09.533 --> 01:03:12.433
It happened seven minutes ago.

01:03:12.467 --> 01:03:14.633
Couple that with the fact
that I've overheard complaints

01:03:14.634 --> 01:03:16.767
about how long it takes him
to get to his desk...

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800
he's a bit of a talker, you see...

01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:21.700
I estimate I have
two to three minutes left.

01:03:21.734 --> 01:03:25.167
Someone has been pretending.

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.634
Pilfered the aspirin bottle.

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:29.467
Replaced the original dose of medicine

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.167
with the same amount of aspirin.

01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:32.634
Did sleight of hand with the pills

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:35.101
given to me to take daily.

01:03:35.134 --> 01:03:37.433
What do you want?

01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:39.500
Ma'am.

01:03:39.533 --> 01:03:41.800
I'm here to see

01:03:41.834 --> 01:03:44.634
if the tales of the
extraordinary being are real,

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:47.634
- the half-man, half-creature.
- Patricia.

01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:50.400
But I appreciate your manners.

01:03:53.634 --> 01:03:55.734
I don't know anymore.

01:03:55.767 --> 01:03:57.634
I'm a comic book expert, Patricia.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.467
I believe comic books are
a continuation of documentation

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.567
that has gone on for centuries
of what humans are capable of.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.767
That they are what someone
somewhere saw or felt.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.433
Are you aware that spandex,
the underwear on the outside,

01:04:12.467 --> 01:04:17.034
and boots come from strongmen
in the circus in the 1930s?

01:04:17.067 --> 01:04:18.634
- No.
- The freak show men

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:20.901
who could do
incredible feats of strength.

01:04:20.934 --> 01:04:25.167
I urge you to look past the
capes and monologuing villains.

01:04:25.201 --> 01:04:26.901
Are you with me?

01:04:26.934 --> 01:04:29.101
Yes.

01:04:29.134 --> 01:04:30.867
I only have a minute left.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.500
I believe The Beast may be part of this.

01:04:33.533 --> 01:04:36.001
There are references
to man/animal characters.

01:04:36.034 --> 01:04:39.767
The dual character, the man
who has abilities like animals.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.767
I'd like to meet The Beast,
see if he's real.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.034
If he is,

01:04:45.067 --> 01:04:48.901
then I'll get us all
out of here tomorrow night.

01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:55.700
What's upsetting you, Patricia?

01:04:55.734 --> 01:04:58.533
What if he can't do
these extraordinary things?

01:05:01.234 --> 01:05:04.901
What if he is just unwell?

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:06.634
Like you.

01:05:08.533 --> 01:05:13.201
Everything extraordinary
can be explained away,

01:05:13.234 --> 01:05:16.901
and yet it is true.

01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:19.034
I think deep down you know this.

01:05:19.067 --> 01:05:23.567
Everything we will see and do
will have a basis in science.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.567
But it will have limits.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.500
This is the real world, not a cartoon.

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:33.500
And yet some of us
don't die from bullets.

01:05:33.533 --> 01:05:37.901
Some of us can still bend steel.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.834
That is not a fantasy.

01:05:41.867 --> 01:05:44.667
Hmm.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:48.101
If you really think
you can get us all out,

01:05:48.134 --> 01:05:51.167
then you may meet The Beast.

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:54.901
But for your sake, I hope he likes you.

01:05:56.834 --> 01:05:59.500
Tomorrow night.

01:05:59.533 --> 01:06:02.433
Call a board meeting or whatever.

01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:10.500
What do we call you, sir?

01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:18.400
First name, "Mr." Last name, "Glass."

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:29.634
- What's going on?
- Be careful.

01:06:29.667 --> 01:06:31.532
- What... Oh.
- Not too much pressure when restraining him.

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:32.666
Dr. Staple, what are you doing?

01:06:32.667 --> 01:06:33.767
- It's a sedative.
- What?

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.200
- I'm sorry to do this, Elijah.
- Ow!

01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:37.500
We saw footage of you
leaving your room last night.

01:06:37.533 --> 01:06:38.933
- No. No.
- It seems you have been duping us.

01:06:38.934 --> 01:06:40.901
I've moved up the procedure
to this morning.

01:06:40.934 --> 01:06:42.001
Wait, I...

01:06:59.201 --> 01:07:01.901
Thank you for being careful, everyone.

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:03.667
Good luck, Elijah.

01:07:05.001 --> 01:07:07.167
Nothing essential is going to change

01:07:07.201 --> 01:07:09.134
about who you are.

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:11.467
I promise, my friend.

01:07:26.634 --> 01:07:28.600
Elijah!

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:55.834
Elijah!

01:07:58.034 --> 01:07:59.934
So let's all scream!

01:08:14.533 --> 01:08:17.001
Elijah!

01:08:17.034 --> 01:08:18.967
Ma'am, get ahold of yourself.

01:08:20.167 --> 01:08:22.834
Mama!

01:08:28.934 --> 01:08:30.700
Elijah!

01:08:30.734 --> 01:08:32.600
Stop the ride!

01:08:32.634 --> 01:08:34.767
- Ma'am, step down.
- Stop the ride!

01:09:14.634 --> 01:09:16.901
♪ If love's a song...

01:09:16.934 --> 01:09:19.634
Dinner, Elijah.

01:09:21.001 --> 01:09:22.667

Hey.

01:09:51.734 --> 01:09:55.667
Took a bitch-ass long time

You don't know what it's like, Daryl.

To be so different,
you don't know where you fit.

01:11:22.067 --> 01:11:24.734
It's an awful feeling.

01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:38.600
Hey there, buddy. What's up?

01:11:38.634 --> 01:11:40.034
Patricia told us you were coming.

01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:43.500
My name is Luke, and I am
Team Horde all the way.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:45.600
Yeah, I can intro you to everybody.

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.634
I ain't no bad hombre to know.

01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:49.833
Everybody's gonna tell you
that I got a big mouth, though,

01:11:49.834 --> 01:11:52.101
I spoil the end of movies. Ain't true.

01:11:52.134 --> 01:11:54.967
Everybody knows the priest dies
at the end of <i>The Exorcist.</i>

The American Sublime.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.767
Do you even know what that means? No.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.901
That is why this world is a lost cause.

01:12:06.934 --> 01:12:08.734
That is why The Beast is

01:12:08.767 --> 01:12:10.867
the only thing that is
pure and meaningful...

01:12:10.901 --> 01:12:13.867
American Sublime refers to
Western paintings of landscapes

01:12:13.901 --> 01:12:16.634
and seascapes depicting
the immensity of nature.

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:18.634
The use of violent storms
in the distance

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.834
was a common practice.

01:12:20.867 --> 01:12:23.467
Painting's of particular interest to me.

01:12:26.734 --> 01:12:29.700
Hey, Miss Patricia says
that your bones can break

01:12:29.734 --> 01:12:31.767
if I, like, tap them.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.967
Is that true?

01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:34.500
Yes.

01:12:34.533 --> 01:12:36.500
Uh, so what's your superpower?

01:12:36.533 --> 01:12:38.667
Your-your mind?

01:12:39.967 --> 01:12:41.934
What's mine?

01:12:45.134 --> 01:12:48.101
You're nine forever, right?

01:12:48.134 --> 01:12:50.101
Yeah.

01:12:50.134 --> 01:12:52.600
That's incredible.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:55.767
You can see the world
the way it really is.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.667
Always.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.134
Kid who can never grow old.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.500
Are you ready?

01:13:06.934 --> 01:13:10.901
Are you ready?

01:13:10.934 --> 01:13:13.034
Yeah.

01:13:13.067 --> 01:13:15.001
Whoa.

01:13:18.034 --> 01:13:21.167
This place is so cool, Mr. Glass.

01:13:21.201 --> 01:13:24.467
I feel like dancing.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.467
Then go ahead and dance.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.533
Yeah! Check it!

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.400
Yeah.

01:13:44.034 --> 01:13:46.533
Oh, man.

01:14:35.867 --> 01:14:39.567
They've been lying to us all.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.433
You believe?

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:46.934
Yes, I do.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.767
It's what I've believed my whole life.

01:14:55.201 --> 01:14:59.134
They are losing faith.

01:14:59.167 --> 01:15:04.767
My Horde is losing faith!

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.567
In comics...

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.901
you would go to a public place
where all could see you.

01:15:11.934 --> 01:15:15.734
A place celebrating
man's pedestrian achievements.

01:15:17.567 --> 01:15:22.600
But you need David to convince them.

01:15:22.634 --> 01:15:25.167
You should fight him

01:15:25.201 --> 01:15:27.700
in front of the world.

01:15:29.634 --> 01:15:33.767
The tallest building
in this city is opening today.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:40.634
All the cameras in the world
will record you.

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:45.767
You can convince the Horde
and the world at the same time.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.034
We exist.

01:15:53.234 --> 01:15:59.500
Why are you in this chair, child?

01:15:59.533 --> 01:16:03.567
My bones break easily.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.134
I was born this way.

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:09.134
I've had 94 breaks in my life.

01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:12.767
I've known only pain.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.800
Rejoice.

01:16:15.834 --> 01:16:22.067
You have suffered and are now pure.

01:16:22.101 --> 01:16:26.767
I assume you were sent here
to be an avenging angel.

01:16:28.634 --> 01:16:31.767
How much do you want to avenge us?

01:16:47.667 --> 01:16:52.767
Well, that sounds like
the bad guys teaming up.

01:16:56.934 --> 01:16:59.567
How you doing, David?

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.101
I always thought of us as friends.

01:17:02.134 --> 01:17:04.600
Elijah?

01:17:04.634 --> 01:17:07.034
You shouldn't be hiding
in the shadows, David.

01:17:07.067 --> 01:17:09.901
You're able to hide
because people who steal cars

01:17:09.934 --> 01:17:13.734
and mug people in alleys
don't need your full potential.

01:17:13.767 --> 01:17:15.634
You're only using
one percent of your abilities

01:17:15.667 --> 01:17:17.201
with these petty criminals.

01:17:17.234 --> 01:17:20.734
Maybe there's nothing to hide, Elijah.

01:17:20.767 --> 01:17:22.134
I have found someone

01:17:22.167 --> 01:17:26.034
who will require your
full potential to come out.

01:17:26.067 --> 01:17:28.634
A superhuman serial killer.

01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:32.034
Don't do this.

01:17:32.067 --> 01:17:34.634
How can we be the only ones?

01:17:34.667 --> 01:17:37.800
Maybe we believed something
that isn't even true.

01:17:38.934 --> 01:17:43.167
We are going to the
tallest building in the city.

01:17:43.201 --> 01:17:45.934
The Horde is going to be revealed there.

01:17:45.967 --> 01:17:47.533
There are three floors

01:17:47.567 --> 01:17:49.634
that house a chemical company
in that building.

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:51.767
I am going to blow up that building

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.634
using their chemicals, David.

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:57.467
You might want to try and stop us.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.134
Today is your coming-out party.

01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:02.967
At least you know what to wear.

01:18:09.067 --> 01:18:12.533
I've turned off the water hoses
in your room, David.

01:18:12.567 --> 01:18:15.167
- There's only the door left.
- Elijah.

01:18:15.201 --> 01:18:16.767
It's metal.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.500
But you can't get through it

01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:21.034
because people's bones break
against metal,

01:18:21.067 --> 01:18:23.667
and you're nothing special.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:28.800
A lot of people are
going to die, Overseer,

01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:32.634
if you don't get through that door.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.901
Hi.

01:19:03.867 --> 01:19:05.567
I'm here.

01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:25.767
Daryl?

01:20:21.533 --> 01:20:23.901
This is where they would paint you

01:20:23.934 --> 01:20:28.934
with big eyes and bubbles
of confusion above your head.

01:20:38.134 --> 01:20:43.101
You... hurt him?

01:20:43.134 --> 01:20:45.034
What are you doing?

01:20:45.067 --> 01:20:50.500
You should kneel before him.

01:20:50.533 --> 01:20:53.433
He is the broken.

01:20:53.467 --> 01:20:55.767
Step away from me.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.901
Get back in your room! Both of you!

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.767
You're fighting for the broken.

01:21:16.533 --> 01:21:18.001
You found your purpose.

01:21:48.567 --> 01:21:52.600
One of the Horde may need
to walk us out of here,

01:21:52.634 --> 01:21:56.001
if that's okay... partner.

01:23:04.167 --> 01:23:06.467
Go through the basement.

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:02.901
Listen to me, Joseph.

01:25:02.934 --> 01:25:04.967
Your father is making great progress.

01:25:05.001 --> 01:25:07.600
I'm very hopeful for him.

01:25:07.634 --> 01:25:13.433
Did you know the first Superman
couldn't even fly?

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.634
And Metropolis is actually
New York City.

01:25:17.667 --> 01:25:19.067
And what about all the coincidences

01:25:19.101 --> 01:25:20.634
in what I was reading?

01:25:20.667 --> 01:25:23.467
Comic books are an obsession.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:28.634
Have you ever been
to a comic book convention?

01:25:28.667 --> 01:25:31.867
They sell teen TV shows there.

01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:34.867
They are selling things.

01:25:34.901 --> 01:25:39.934
Your friends and family members
have lost their perspective.

01:25:41.867 --> 01:25:45.500
Your dad is trying
to fight her abductor.

01:25:45.533 --> 01:25:48.600
Your son is trying to best his dad.

01:25:48.634 --> 01:25:50.834
He's the anarchist.

01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:53.001
He's the brains.
He's the reluctant hero.

01:25:53.034 --> 01:25:56.634
This all sounds very familiar,
doesn't it?

01:25:56.667 --> 01:26:00.634
Comic books are not valid history.

01:26:10.234 --> 01:26:13.700
Hey, what wing are you with?

01:26:13.734 --> 01:26:16.567
Uh, The Beast
is saying that he'd like you

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.800
to roll forward when they come.

01:26:22.533 --> 01:26:24.433
I believe.

01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:26.867
I believe.

01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:30.901
I believe.

01:26:36.734 --> 01:26:38.533
I believe.

01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:34.034
The new Osaka building
opens today with much fanfare.

01:27:34.067 --> 01:27:36.734
Thousands are expected
to come out for the ceremony.

01:27:36.767 --> 01:27:39.001
Many just want to see
the spectacular architecture.

01:27:39.034 --> 01:27:41.034
Now, this building is expected

01:27:41.067 --> 01:27:43.167
to be the hub of the business community,

01:27:43.201 --> 01:27:44.667
creating thousands of jobs...

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.734
We have a Code Three.

01:27:46.767 --> 01:27:48.533
All patients locked in their rooms.

01:27:48.567 --> 01:27:50.634
Grounds security on alert.

01:27:50.667 --> 01:27:52.433
The patients are planning to go

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:54.101
to the public opening
of the Osaka Tower,

01:27:54.134 --> 01:27:55.600
the tallest building.

01:27:55.634 --> 01:27:57.114
Elijah may be intending to compromise

01:27:57.134 --> 01:27:58.734
a chemical facility there.

01:27:58.767 --> 01:28:01.500
Please alert the
Philadelphia Police Department.

01:28:01.533 --> 01:28:04.500
They made a mistake
going through the basement.

01:28:04.533 --> 01:28:06.533
It gives us some time.

01:28:06.567 --> 01:28:08.634
I remember something

01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:10.901
about a classic public forum

01:28:10.934 --> 01:28:13.734
where the climax
of limited editions end.

01:28:13.767 --> 01:28:16.767
Uh, I think he said it was
referred to as the showdown,

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.167
where all the skills are revealed

01:28:19.201 --> 01:28:22.800
and-and pitted against each other.

01:28:22.834 --> 01:28:24.700
And then?

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.967
What happens?

01:28:52.034 --> 01:28:53.800
Christ, they're out here.

01:28:53.834 --> 01:28:55.101
They're out here!

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.167
This is Dr. Ellie Staple.

01:29:11.201 --> 01:29:12.567
We will need assistance

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.934
at Raven Hill Memorial immediately.

01:29:35.934 --> 01:29:38.467
No!

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.767
How many people are gonna die today?

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.034
Huh?

01:29:47.067 --> 01:29:48.533
I don't want to do this.

01:29:48.567 --> 01:29:50.034
I don't care what Patricia says.

01:29:50.067 --> 01:29:52.001
I'm not...

01:29:52.034 --> 01:29:54.767
Hedwig's taking the light.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.201
Hey, what's up?

01:29:57.234 --> 01:29:59.134
Don't worry.

01:29:59.167 --> 01:30:00.767
We don't need him anyway.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:03.901
There are still ten of us.

01:30:10.034 --> 01:30:13.967
It appears The Beast
is not done here yet.

01:30:36.834 --> 01:30:39.201
We've got eyes on him. Please advise.

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.934
Please advise.

01:31:01.467 --> 01:31:04.700
The collection of main characters.

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:50.533
Keep patients and staff away
from the south-side windows.

01:31:50.567 --> 01:31:52.533
Authorities are on their way.

01:32:13.967 --> 01:32:15.467
Okay. I got you.

01:32:22.834 --> 01:32:27.167
You will learn to kneel
before the broken.

01:33:14.567 --> 01:33:17.167
I need to explain.
He has D.I.D.

01:33:17.201 --> 01:33:19.600
- He believes he's an animal.
- Keep moving.

01:33:19.634 --> 01:33:21.034
No, you don't understand.

01:33:21.067 --> 01:33:22.634
All he knows is pain.

01:33:22.667 --> 01:33:24.134
You're going to get hurt.

01:33:24.167 --> 01:33:25.834
Somebody, please...

01:33:25.867 --> 01:33:27.567
He has D.I.D.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.200
We can get the compassionate
people inside him

01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:30.634
- to help you.
- Stay here.

01:33:30.667 --> 01:33:33.800
You're the girl The Beast let go.

01:34:03.667 --> 01:34:05.800
Stay away from him.

01:34:05.834 --> 01:34:08.400
Go!

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:34.301
I'm just trying to save you.

01:35:09.634 --> 01:35:12.834
Casey, the light
won't work out here now.

01:35:12.867 --> 01:35:15.800
You have to be the one
to get Kevin to come out.

01:35:15.834 --> 01:35:17.967
We need to get them inside to safety.

01:35:18.001 --> 01:35:19.767
Do you hear me?

01:35:21.467 --> 01:35:22.734
Dad, there are two

01:35:22.767 --> 01:35:24.001
tactical teams on the way.

01:35:24.034 --> 01:35:25.800
Get back inside!

01:35:31.234 --> 01:35:32.834
Hurry.

01:35:32.867 --> 01:35:34.433
Get inside the building.

01:35:45.667 --> 01:35:48.201
The water used for David's room.

01:35:48.234 --> 01:35:49.967
There's water in that tank.

01:35:50.001 --> 01:35:52.533
I know he almost drowned
when he was a child.

01:35:52.567 --> 01:35:54.934
Water is his weakness.

01:35:56.734 --> 01:35:58.134
Hey!

01:35:58.167 --> 01:35:59.167
- Hey!
- Joseph!

01:35:59.201 --> 01:36:00.634
He's lying to you.

01:36:00.667 --> 01:36:02.767
In comics, the parents of the villains

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.600
always hold a key to understanding them.

01:36:05.634 --> 01:36:07.567
He's not telling you something.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.400
Joseph, get back!

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:15.934
Don't tell him yet.

01:36:17.934 --> 01:36:22.167
Kevin's dad didn't just take
any train and not come home.

01:36:38.201 --> 01:36:40.067
Eastrail 177.

01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:42.400
Next stop, Philadelphia.

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:13.067
<i>He took the train my dad was on.</i>

01:37:13.101 --> 01:37:16.834
<i>The one that everyone died
except my dad.</i>

01:37:23.533 --> 01:37:25.533
That's the key to who you are.

01:37:27.533 --> 01:37:30.533
Mr. Glass killed Kevin's dad.

01:37:43.867 --> 01:37:46.567
It's all evidence, you see?

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.767
If that train crash hadn't happened,

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.700
Kevin wouldn't have been
left alone with his mother.

01:37:51.734 --> 01:37:53.134
If Kevin's mother wasn't allowed

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:54.166
to continue to abuse him,

01:37:54.167 --> 01:37:57.433
then The Beast
wouldn't have had to be born.

01:37:57.467 --> 01:38:00.067
What are the odds that David Dunn

01:38:00.101 --> 01:38:06.067
and Clarence Wendell Crumb
would be together that day?

01:38:06.101 --> 01:38:07.800
Amazing.

01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:13.567
I created you, as I created David.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.167
It just took longer.

01:38:17.201 --> 01:38:19.634
19 years.

01:38:19.667 --> 01:38:22.901
They almost convinced me I was crazy.

01:38:22.934 --> 01:38:27.533
I create superheroes.

01:38:27.567 --> 01:38:32.167
I truly am a mastermind.

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:39.034
I thank you for what you did.

01:38:39.067 --> 01:38:42.700
But I came to protect Kevin.

01:38:42.734 --> 01:38:49.101
And I cannot trust you to keep him safe.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.967
Hey.

01:38:55.001 --> 01:38:57.700
We still haven't settled
that kneeling thing.

01:38:57.734 --> 01:39:00.667
The classic turn.

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:03.067
The enemy becomes the ally

01:39:03.101 --> 01:39:08.001
because of the hero's
unflinching sense of good.

01:40:38.934 --> 01:40:43.533
We will finish this
in front of the world.

01:41:00.533 --> 01:41:02.600
Elijah.

01:41:12.234 --> 01:41:13.934
Release me.

01:41:18.467 --> 01:41:20.433
Let me talk to Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:41:22.201 --> 01:41:24.167
No!

01:41:27.533 --> 01:41:29.901
Release me.

01:41:29.934 --> 01:41:32.134
I need to talk to Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:41:34.901 --> 01:41:36.934
He needs me.

01:41:36.967 --> 01:41:38.967
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:41:41.101 --> 01:41:42.167
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:41:44.533 --> 01:41:46.667
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:41:57.167 --> 01:41:58.934
Hey.

01:42:00.967 --> 01:42:02.767
The Beast listened to me.

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.634
He couldn't do what he wanted.

01:42:04.667 --> 01:42:06.767
You can tell him what to do.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.500
- I'm not in charge of the light.
- Yes.

01:42:10.533 --> 01:42:13.500
Yes, you are.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.467
It feels good.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.001
Doesn't it?

01:42:20.034 --> 01:42:22.834
Mm-hmm.

01:42:22.867 --> 01:42:26.901
Will you stay in the light with me?

01:42:26.934 --> 01:42:28.867
For a little while?

01:42:52.301 --> 01:42:55.767
She was able
to turn him. Target down.

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:14.034
You guys got to help him. That's my dad.

01:43:14.067 --> 01:43:15.634
He's trying to help you guys.

01:43:15.667 --> 01:43:17.134
The guy in the green, that's my dad.

01:43:17.167 --> 01:43:19.901
He's trying to stop the Horde.
He's really weak.

01:43:57.467 --> 01:43:59.867
David.

01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:01.201
David, take my hand.

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:02.834
Take it now!

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.700
It's just us.

01:44:34.634 --> 01:44:37.034
They sent me here for you three.

01:44:37.067 --> 01:44:40.034
Tell me the truth.

01:44:40.067 --> 01:44:43.433
Did I almost convince you
you were an ordinary man?

01:44:46.634 --> 01:44:49.700
I would have left you alone,

01:44:49.734 --> 01:44:54.834
but when the Horde showed up
here, then I just had to come.

01:45:10.034 --> 01:45:12.634
Didn't you tell me there was a showdown

01:45:12.667 --> 01:45:14.934
at the end of a limited edition?

01:45:14.967 --> 01:45:17.433
How come you didn't know
how it was gonna end?

01:45:17.467 --> 01:45:19.001
Oh, Mama.

01:45:19.034 --> 01:45:24.500
This is not a limited edition.

01:45:24.533 --> 01:45:28.167
This was an origin story

01:45:28.201 --> 01:45:30.934
the whole time.

01:45:54.034 --> 01:45:56.034
What's happening?

01:46:00.934 --> 01:46:03.034
I like being nine.

01:46:04.934 --> 01:46:07.533
It... it hurts, Casey.

01:46:07.567 --> 01:46:09.101
Get it to stop hurting.

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:15.134
I-I can't... hold on
to the light, Casey.

01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:21.834
I should never have listened to her.

01:46:26.234 --> 01:46:28.901
Now these pants got blood on them.

01:46:28.934 --> 01:46:30.500
They're ruined.

01:46:32.867 --> 01:46:35.867
We got to clean these pants, Casey.

01:46:37.967 --> 01:46:41.734
As his body slowly
succumbs to the inevitable,

01:46:41.767 --> 01:46:47.167
a sensation of cold water
spreads through his body.

01:46:47.201 --> 01:46:53.634
His thoughts are a mixture
of fear and sweet relief.

01:46:55.734 --> 01:46:58.433
Ladies and gentlemen, here's Patricia.

01:46:58.467 --> 01:47:00.901
We should all listen to her.

01:47:02.901 --> 01:47:04.767
Did you see them?

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:08.600
They are both extraordinary.

01:47:08.634 --> 01:47:11.433
I never doubted. I...

01:47:11.467 --> 01:47:15.433
Never let them tell you I doubted it.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.634
They're all so scared.

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:24.767
But I told them that I'm gonna
hold the light now.

01:47:27.667 --> 01:47:30.767
You really my friend?

01:47:33.667 --> 01:47:35.700
Then I'm gonna hold the light
till the end.

01:47:35.734 --> 01:47:37.467
Till the very end.

01:47:40.533 --> 01:47:43.400
It's not so bad being in the light.

01:47:52.001 --> 01:47:53.934
Kevin.

01:48:30.201 --> 01:48:33.500
Would you mind
stepping away for a moment

01:48:33.533 --> 01:48:35.734
so I can check him?

01:48:37.667 --> 01:48:39.767
It's okay.

01:48:58.201 --> 01:49:00.533
They got it wrong in the comics.

01:49:02.234 --> 01:49:04.201
They talk about secret evil groups

01:49:04.234 --> 01:49:06.734
trying to stop the heroes.

01:49:06.767 --> 01:49:09.167
I don't think we are particularly evil,

01:49:09.201 --> 01:49:12.067
and we don't choose sides.

01:49:12.101 --> 01:49:13.901
We try to stop both of you.

01:49:13.934 --> 01:49:18.934
If there is one of you,
the opposite of you appears.

01:49:18.967 --> 01:49:20.201
It escalates.

01:49:20.234 --> 01:49:22.533
We step in.

01:49:22.567 --> 01:49:26.533
There just can't be gods amongst us.

01:49:26.567 --> 01:49:27.934
It's not fair.

01:49:27.967 --> 01:49:33.467
It has worked just fine
for 10,000 years our way.

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.700
Take consolation in the fact

01:49:35.734 --> 01:49:39.001
that you were right about your theory.

01:49:39.034 --> 01:49:41.967
Be at peace.

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:06.600
I wasn't a mistake, Mama.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:08.934
No.

01:50:11.001 --> 01:50:13.800
You were spectacular.

01:50:30.834 --> 01:50:34.034
<i>These patients were very disturbed.</i>

01:50:34.067 --> 01:50:36.667
<i>Let me just simply state,
everything that occurred</i>

01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.800
<i>was related to drugs in their systems</i>

01:50:38.834 --> 01:50:40.767
<i>or their heightened state of mania.</i>

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.767
<i>For the patients' privacy,</i>

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.634
let's keep what happened
in this building

01:50:44.667 --> 01:50:47.467
and this parking lot to ourselves.

01:50:48.734 --> 01:50:49.834
...general public alike.

01:50:49.867 --> 01:50:51.166
Opening ceremonies have concluded,

01:50:51.167 --> 01:50:52.867
but from the looks on the faces

01:50:52.901 --> 01:50:55.001
of the thousand...

01:51:29.934 --> 01:51:32.467
All three were real.

01:51:34.067 --> 01:51:37.700
Quite special, actually.

01:51:37.734 --> 01:51:42.600
If you approve,
I will move to the next city.

01:51:42.634 --> 01:51:45.167
Will there be any repercussions?

01:51:45.201 --> 01:51:47.600
No one saw them.

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:50.800
I know what my charge is.

01:51:50.834 --> 01:51:52.700
Convince them.

01:51:52.734 --> 01:51:56.634
This is the most humane
and effective method.

01:51:56.667 --> 01:52:00.667
We're not executioners,
and we don't need martyrs.

01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:04.634
If that fails, use the machine.

01:52:04.667 --> 01:52:08.167
And I understand how important
what we're doing is.

01:52:08.201 --> 01:52:11.167
Maintaining balance.

01:52:11.201 --> 01:52:13.567
Keeping order.

01:52:35.001 --> 01:52:36.901
We're not here to buy umbrellas,

01:52:36.934 --> 01:52:37.834
and you know it.

01:52:37.867 --> 01:52:39.800
Spread your wings, Mr. K.G. Bird.

01:52:39.834 --> 01:52:41.767
We're flying you down to headquarters.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.433
On what charge, Boy Wonder?

01:52:44.467 --> 01:52:45.834
Illegal umbrellas.

01:52:45.867 --> 01:52:48.001
Assault and battery,
disturbing the peace.

01:52:48.034 --> 01:52:51.201
We've got enough to put you
back on ice, Penguin.

01:52:51.234 --> 01:52:53.433
♪ I don't look backward

01:52:53.467 --> 01:52:57.634
♪ I don't look to side or side ♪

01:52:57.667 --> 01:52:59.433
♪ I'm focused on the prize...

01:52:59.467 --> 01:53:00.700
He's too smart.

01:53:00.734 --> 01:53:03.001
That's why he's the mastermind.

01:53:03.034 --> 01:53:05.934
He'll never tell you his real plan.

01:53:05.967 --> 01:53:07.433
He sets everybody up.

01:53:07.467 --> 01:53:09.134
Gets them looking in one direction.

01:53:09.167 --> 01:53:11.167
So cool, man.

01:53:11.201 --> 01:53:14.834
There's always a real plan.

01:53:25.201 --> 01:53:27.433
You see this camera?

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:30.067
There are 100 more of these.

01:53:30.101 --> 01:53:33.001
Everything is being recorded.

01:53:41.901 --> 01:53:44.101
<i>All videos and all backup videos</i>

01:53:44.134 --> 01:53:47.500
<i>- have been erased, correct?
- Yes.</i>

01:53:47.533 --> 01:53:49.967
Was any of it downloaded before that?

01:53:57.967 --> 01:54:00.767
I don't know how this is possible.

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:03.800
Someone was streaming
the live security feed

01:54:03.834 --> 01:54:05.867
to a private site.

01:54:29.934 --> 01:54:32.034
He went through the basement tunnels

01:54:32.067 --> 01:54:34.934
to be seen by
as many cameras as possible.

01:54:34.967 --> 01:54:38.901
That's why he didn't go out
the side entrance.

01:54:38.934 --> 01:54:40.700
<i>He was never planning</i>

01:54:40.734 --> 01:54:42.600
<i>on going to that building.</i>

01:54:45.167 --> 01:54:47.667
This was a suicide mission.

01:54:48.934 --> 01:54:52.834
I gave him all the cameras
he needed right here.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:07.667
What have you done, Elijah?

01:56:03.467 --> 01:56:05.167
There are unknown forces

01:56:05.201 --> 01:56:09.667
that don't want us to realize
what we are truly capable of.

01:56:11.767 --> 01:56:14.700
They don't want us
to know the things we suspect

01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:18.167
are extraordinary
about ourselves are real.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:33.867
<i>I believe that if everyone sees
what just a few people become</i>

01:56:33.901 --> 01:56:37.034
<i>when they wholly embrace their gifts,</i>

01:56:37.067 --> 01:56:39.368
<i>others will awaken.</i>

01:56:43.234 --> 01:56:48.967
<i>Belief in oneself is contagious.</i>

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:53.467
<i>We give each other permission
to be superheroes.</i>

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:57.500
<i>We will never awaken otherwise.</i>

01:57:03.634 --> 01:57:05.934
<i>Whoever these people are</i>

01:57:05.967 --> 01:57:09.567
<i>who don't want us to know the truth,</i>

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.700
<i>today, they lose.</i>

01:57:40.034 --> 01:57:41.800
Thanks.

01:57:49.967 --> 01:57:53.467
How long's it been since we posted it?

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.734
Two hours.

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.700
How long will it be before...?

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.700
I know what this is.

01:59:01.101 --> 01:59:05.634
This is the moment
we are let in on the universe.
