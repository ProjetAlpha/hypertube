WEBVTT

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:14.325
Well, we get in these big boats

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.455
and it takes us right up to
where the water's coming down.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.215
Right up to the edge.

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:20.696
If we're lucky, we might actually see

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.185
- some people coming over in barrels.
- Barrels?

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:24.553
It's a thing in Niagara Falls.

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:26.355
People put themselves
in these big barrels...

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:29.591
like pickle barrels.
They just hold tight and...

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:34.739
No, no, they don't.

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:36.667
I'm telling you.

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:38.935
- No, they don't.
- Okay, fine.

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:41.570
I guess you'll just have to wait and see
for yourself, then.

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:44.373
It's saying two hours and 20 minutes.

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:47.744
- Okay.
- We should get gas.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.646
We still have a quarter of a tank.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.448
Let's just fill it up, please.

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:54.337
Okay.

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:02.625
- What was that?
- I don't know.

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:03.960
What happened?

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:10.000
You got it.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:11.509
You got it, you got it, you got it.

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:12.534
Look.

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.269
- I'm not even doing anything.
- Whoa!

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:16.372
All right, I'll push.
All right, crank the wheel.

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.558
That's it.

00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:19.851
Nice work.

00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:21.577
You've got some strong muscles, boy.

00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:26.281
We still don't have service.

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:28.584
All right, so we'll find a phone.

00:01:28.617 --> 00:01:30.786
Somebody'll take a look at it tonight.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:35.724
What are you doing?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.926
We're not hitchhiking!

00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:42.599
Adam!

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.505
Okay, I guess we're walking, then.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.570
I saw a sign for lodging up the road.

00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:49.973
We can call a mechanic there.

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.021
I... I know a guy. I can call him.

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:56.682
But I can tell you right now,

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.378
he isn't gonna do no work tonight.

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:00.163
How much for a room with two beds?

00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:01.653
59.

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:11.178
- Oh, God.
- What?

00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:12.404
My wallet.

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.835
I left it in the car.

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:17.743
It's okay.

00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:19.504
We'll get it in the morning, okay?

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:33.719
Hey.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.025
How are we gonna get to
Niagara Falls without a car?

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:43.317
Oh, we still have our car.

00:02:43.437 --> 00:02:45.675
We're gonna get it fixed
first thing in the morning.

00:02:45.797 --> 00:02:47.532
We'll see the falls tomorrow.

00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:53.230
<i>Given the changes that are
happening to liquidity,</i>

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.694
<i>many of those same investors
are not appreciating...</i>

00:02:56.782 --> 00:03:01.211
I know, I just... You're just
acting like it's no big deal.

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.168
- And it is a big deal for him.
- I know that.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.351
For me, too.

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.399
The car breaking down has
nothing to do with my attitude,

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.499
Bess, okay?

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.335
I'm just trying
to make this fun for him.

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:13.644
We shouldn't be spending the night here.

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:16.000
Well, I can't exactly barge
into some mechanic's place

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:17.714
and pull him off his couch
right now, can I?

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.610
- I know, I just...
- Okay.

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:21.678
- What do you wanna do?
- It's just that...

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:28.452
Hey, buddy.

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:30.756
How you doing? You good?

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:37.162
Come on, let's get ready
for bed, all right?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.977
Hey, what's the matter?

00:03:54.912 --> 00:03:56.981
Did you have that nightmare again?

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:02.388
- What's going on?
- I wanna go home.

00:04:02.887 --> 00:04:04.156
Oh, honey.

00:04:08.792 --> 00:04:10.761
Hey, it's okay.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:16.615
This is just a little... delay.

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:19.503
You're okay.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.940
Hey.

00:04:34.853 --> 00:04:35.921
Come on.

00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:42.528

Mechanic's finishing up a job.

00:05:44.688 --> 00:05:45.990
He's calling me back in an hour.

00:05:46.294 --> 00:05:48.964
- What time is it?
- 8:15.

00:05:49.894 --> 00:05:51.763
Where's Julian?

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:55.033
I introduced him to the joys
of the breakfast bar.

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:58.640
He's getting us tea. He insisted.

00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:01.823
And I'm gonna take a nice, hot shower.

00:06:01.886 --> 00:06:04.052
- You left him there?
- Yeah.

00:06:04.142 --> 00:06:05.543
I did.

00:06:06.842 --> 00:06:08.078
And he's fine.

00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:11.884
Hey.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.786
He's fine, okay? He's a big boy.

00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:20.591
- He...
- It's okay.

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:38.108
You're such a bad father.

00:06:40.178 --> 00:06:41.980
The worst.

00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:32.026
It's me!

00:07:40.004 --> 00:07:42.093
Look at you.

00:07:42.173 --> 00:07:44.909
Oh, thank you. This is so nice.

00:07:44.982 --> 00:07:48.070
Our room service is here.

00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:50.815
Thank you. Mmm, smells like licorice.

00:07:50.848 --> 00:07:53.110
Oh.

00:07:53.418 --> 00:07:56.421
Oh. I'm gonna take a shower.

00:07:56.499 --> 00:07:58.757
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

00:08:08.766 --> 00:08:11.736
<i>And it's looking like a few
more days of fair weather</i>

00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:13.479
<i>with rain on the horizon...</i>

00:09:20.238 --> 00:09:21.363
Adam...

00:09:30.013 --> 00:09:31.815
Are you okay?

00:09:37.854 --> 00:09:38.922
Adam?

00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:05.767
Julian.

00:10:09.286 --> 00:10:10.921

00:11:52.036 --> 00:11:53.738
- Jeannie.
- Hey.

00:11:53.763 --> 00:11:55.433
- Gonna be in the back?
- Yeah, he's back there.

00:11:58.822 --> 00:11:59.923
Dad.

00:12:02.258 --> 00:12:03.913
I'll be right there.

00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:06.553
There we go. Thank you, Jeannie.

00:12:10.468 --> 00:12:12.203
I ran into the Hendersons.

00:12:13.887 --> 00:12:15.657
And they asked about you.

00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:17.505
They were really hoping
you can make it tonight.

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:19.018
You show up, eat some barbecue...

00:12:19.045 --> 00:12:22.615
I don't... No, all of those
couples and screaming kids.

00:12:22.647 --> 00:12:24.816
You got something against kids now?

00:12:24.849 --> 00:12:26.018
Maybe you'll meet somebody there.

00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:27.409
At Helen's? Come on.

00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:28.632
- Dad...
- You don't know.

00:12:28.657 --> 00:12:29.822
No.

00:12:29.854 --> 00:12:31.690
Besides, I've got a break-in
up in Ansville.

00:12:31.723 --> 00:12:32.992
And then I gotta go food shopping...

00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:34.593
- Hey, Patrick.
- What are you doing?

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:35.627
Looking good. What?

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.762
- Dad.
- What?

00:12:36.804 --> 00:12:38.573
It's dressing. I'm eating salad.

00:12:38.598 --> 00:12:41.668
- Ranch is all cholesterol.
- It's a salad for lunch.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.035
I'm serious. Jeannie?

00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:45.304
No more ranch for him from now on, okay?

00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:46.573
You got it, sweetie.

00:12:49.074 --> 00:12:50.609
Hey.

00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:54.780
What do you mean, a 10-35?

00:12:57.817 --> 00:13:00.583
Who's there now? No, don't do anything.

00:13:00.617 --> 00:13:03.853
- I'm coming. I'll be right there.
- No, no.

00:13:03.923 --> 00:13:05.625
I gotta go.

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:10.129
What the hell's a 10-35?

00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:25.815
Hey.

00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:27.847
Hey.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.553
- Where's F.I.U.?
- On the way from Syracuse.

00:13:30.617 --> 00:13:32.819
EMTs are calling them deceased.

00:13:32.852 --> 00:13:34.958
Supposedly it's a couple in their 30s.

00:13:34.989 --> 00:13:36.589
Checked in last night with their son.

00:13:38.057 --> 00:13:40.187
- There's three of them in there?
- I don't know.

00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:42.131
They told me to just
hold down the scene, so...

00:13:56.048 --> 00:13:57.317
Jesus.

00:14:10.298 --> 00:14:12.067
Are these rocks?

00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:16.734
- Who else has been in here?
- No one.

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:18.307
What about the housekeeper?

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.942
She says she didn't step inside.

00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:22.277
She didn't move the bodies?

00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:24.212
I just said she didn't step inside.

00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:26.914
I was just making sure, Brick.

00:14:26.947 --> 00:14:29.617
I'm gonna ask questions more than once.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.352
All right.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.195
Brick.

00:15:25.073 --> 00:15:26.943
Keller PD! Hands up!

00:15:28.373 --> 00:15:30.011
I said hands up!

00:15:53.632 --> 00:15:55.368
Hey.

00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:58.904
Is it just you? Is anyone else here?

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.518
It's okay.

00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:15.524
You're all right.

00:16:26.743 --> 00:16:28.954
Really? That's what
they're doing nowadays?

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.977
You expect the kid to call you?
That's how things work now?

00:16:34.397 --> 00:16:36.461
Look, I'm just saying nothing's
gonna change

00:16:36.508 --> 00:16:37.850
until you call her.

00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:38.969
- You know?
- Yeah.

00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:40.183
Say you wanna see your grandson.

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.702
You're a grandpa. You get to nag.

00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:44.203
I don't wanna nag.

00:16:44.237 --> 00:16:46.001
Will you look at that?

00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:49.242
I mean, why do they have to cut
those hedges into right angles?

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:54.881
Where do right angles appear
in nature anywhere, huh?

00:16:54.914 --> 00:16:57.165

<i>I don't know what to call it.</i>

00:18:42.024 --> 00:18:43.849
It's a double murder.

00:18:44.241 --> 00:18:45.510
I think it's a double murder.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.645
- This is in Keller?<i>
- Yeah.</i>

00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:50.182
<i>Just outside of town.</i>

00:18:50.214 --> 00:18:52.416
<i>Look, I know it's not like
we've been in touch at all.</i>

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.084
But my dad talks about you,
and I read about your case

00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:57.005
with that woman a few months ago.

00:18:57.078 --> 00:19:01.322
Eh, they made too big
a deal of that thing.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.782
<i>Well, I could actually use
another set of eyes on this.</i>

00:19:06.205 --> 00:19:08.541
<i>I know you haven't been back
here in a long time,</i>

00:19:08.566 --> 00:19:11.695
<i>but I was hoping maybe
you could come up here</i>

00:19:11.766 --> 00:19:13.210
<i>and take a look.</i>

00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:17.071
The reason is the suspect, he's young.

00:19:17.102 --> 00:19:19.269
Really young. Like, maybe 11 years old.

00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:23.552
<i>Honestly, I have a lot
of eyes on me with this one.</i>

00:19:24.182 --> 00:19:26.708
<i>I don't wanna make the wrong call.</i>

00:19:28.485 --> 00:19:30.898
<i>Anything you can do to help.</i>

00:19:31.828 --> 00:19:33.863
<i>Detective Ambrose?</i>

00:19:57.982 --> 00:19:59.684
Run!

00:20:34.652 --> 00:20:37.322
<i>In local economy news,
the state budget office</i>

00:20:37.384 --> 00:20:39.233
<i>released its jobs report yesterday,</i>

00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:41.995
<i>and the news is not good for our area.</i>

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:45.353
<i>It lays out the news that
unemployment is up,</i>

00:20:45.393 --> 00:20:47.298
<i>jobs are scarce...</i>

00:21:34.112 --> 00:21:36.415
- Detective.
- Wow, look at you.

00:21:36.448 --> 00:21:37.749
Thank you so much for coming up.

00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:38.817
Welcome back.

00:21:40.551 --> 00:21:42.553
Definitely, uh...

00:21:43.587 --> 00:21:47.425
You're all grown up now.
A little young for a detective.

00:21:47.459 --> 00:21:49.428
Well, I'm still on a trial period.

00:21:49.461 --> 00:21:51.829
Not quite gold shield yet.

00:21:51.863 --> 00:21:54.210
How is it being back? It's been a while.

00:21:54.265 --> 00:21:56.635
Yeah, it's... trying
to think about that,

00:21:56.667 --> 00:22:00.571
I think, uh, 15 years or so.

00:22:01.138 --> 00:22:03.439
- For my mom's funeral.
- Yeah.

00:22:03.508 --> 00:22:05.788
And I...

00:22:06.204 --> 00:22:08.273
They're waiting for us probably, huh?

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.306
Uh, I wanted to tell you, um...

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.087
I told the Chief that you were
just visiting my dad

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:18.423
and it was your idea to
come by and help out.

00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:21.393
I didn't tell him I called.

00:22:23.827 --> 00:22:25.097
It's okay.

00:22:27.598 --> 00:22:29.534
All right.

00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:36.554
Okay, so far, what do we have?

00:22:36.635 --> 00:22:38.637
The father's name is Adam Lowry.

00:22:38.717 --> 00:22:40.120
Pennsylvania license.

00:22:40.177 --> 00:22:42.479
A couple of jobs
in and around Allentown.

00:22:42.562 --> 00:22:45.432
Nothing on record
for the past six months.

00:22:45.482 --> 00:22:48.185
We didn't find any ID on her.

00:22:48.219 --> 00:22:49.888
According to the motel manager,
the family had a breakdown

00:22:49.921 --> 00:22:53.125
the family had a breakdown
on their way to Niagara Falls.

00:22:53.157 --> 00:22:55.247
We're trying to locate the car.

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:58.763
And, uh, what do you think
is the cause of death?

00:22:58.796 --> 00:23:00.798
Aside from the fall,
there was no blunt trauma,

00:23:00.831 --> 00:23:03.868
so it's looking like
they ingested something.

00:23:03.902 --> 00:23:06.638
Toxicology's gonna take at least a week.

00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:07.759
How long you gonna be around?

00:23:07.816 --> 00:23:11.421
Oh, I thought I'd stay for a day or so.

00:23:12.844 --> 00:23:15.212
- You okay with that?
- Sure.

00:23:16.847 --> 00:23:20.519
- So you're a Keller native, huh?
- Yeah.

00:23:20.551 --> 00:23:24.222
You must've gone to Putnam
High School back in the day.

00:23:24.254 --> 00:23:25.856
- I went to Garrison.
- Ah.

00:23:25.889 --> 00:23:28.526
It's no wonder we never crossed paths.

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:31.552
Yeah. So, uh...

00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:33.406
Is it a suicide or an overdose?

00:23:33.463 --> 00:23:35.799
I've seen my share of overdoses.

00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:37.282
But the bloodstains and the water,

00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:39.719
it looks like dad was
showering when he collapsed.

00:23:39.804 --> 00:23:41.282
They didn't know what hit them.

00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:46.908
And we have security footage
from the motel.

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:50.199
He was the only one seen going
in and out of the room.

00:23:50.448 --> 00:23:52.918
And his fingerprints
are on both of the mugs.

00:23:53.885 --> 00:23:57.966
So you think that he poisoned
them and then he arranged

00:23:58.037 --> 00:23:59.740
the bodies this way?

00:24:03.396 --> 00:24:05.764
Well, we haven't filed charges yet.

00:24:05.863 --> 00:24:07.465
He's not speaking.

00:24:07.498 --> 00:24:09.433
And since the parents are deceased,

00:24:09.466 --> 00:24:11.202
DSS took him into custody.

00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:16.508
- Where is he now?
- Foster home.

00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:22.586
<i>And then the two veterans,
Martin and Osborne,</i>

00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:24.849
<i>they both won this
championship before...</i>

00:24:24.882 --> 00:24:26.718
<i>He's under guardianship of the state,</i>

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.787
<i>so we'll stay here until we
can locate next of kin.</i>

00:24:28.819 --> 00:24:30.370
As his lawyer, I need to be present

00:24:30.395 --> 00:24:32.991
- any time you speak with him.
- Is he speaking?

00:24:33.032 --> 00:24:34.734
He did start talking this morning.

00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:37.545
Said his name was Julian.

00:24:37.628 --> 00:24:39.180
He's still in shock.

00:24:39.263 --> 00:24:41.599
Hasn't been answering many questions.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.649
Julian?

00:24:57.682 --> 00:24:58.883
There are some people here to see you.

00:24:58.934 --> 00:25:01.228
You remember Detective Novack?

00:25:01.892 --> 00:25:05.344
And this is Detective Ambrose.

00:25:05.656 --> 00:25:07.360
Hello.

00:25:07.825 --> 00:25:10.662
Hi, Julian. How are you doing?

00:25:15.066 --> 00:25:19.357
Um, we're here just
to ask you a few questions

00:25:19.936 --> 00:25:21.973
so we can get a better idea
of how to help.

00:25:24.642 --> 00:25:25.711
Is that okay?

00:25:28.078 --> 00:25:29.681
Can you tell me where you live?

00:25:38.388 --> 00:25:40.958
Where were you going with your parents?

00:25:43.327 --> 00:25:44.363
Niagara Falls.

00:25:46.064 --> 00:25:47.298
Okay.

00:25:48.833 --> 00:25:50.477
Um...

00:25:50.596 --> 00:25:52.904
Was there anyone else
traveling with you?

00:25:55.013 --> 00:25:56.493
Mm.

00:25:56.556 --> 00:25:58.558
What about at the hotel?

00:25:58.776 --> 00:26:00.945
Meet anyone there?

00:26:04.382 --> 00:26:07.686
Did anyone come into
your room at the hotel?

00:26:08.786 --> 00:26:10.655
- No.
- You're sure?

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.992
Julian?

00:26:15.564 --> 00:26:18.029
Can you tell me what
happened that morning?

00:26:25.036 --> 00:26:26.738
What happened to your parents?

00:26:29.106 --> 00:26:30.674
They died.

00:26:33.377 --> 00:26:35.679
How did they die?

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.119
All we wanna know is what you saw.

00:26:43.721 --> 00:26:45.123
Moment by moment.

00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:47.859
That's it.

00:26:50.694 --> 00:26:52.396
They had to go back.

00:26:54.464 --> 00:26:55.701
Who?

00:26:57.801 --> 00:26:59.136
Back where?

00:27:03.907 --> 00:27:05.734
To the beginning.

00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:07.145
What does that mean?

00:27:09.446 --> 00:27:10.748
Julian?

00:27:12.983 --> 00:27:14.852
Julian, help me understand.

00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:22.894
Julian?

00:27:33.037 --> 00:27:35.173
I think that's enough for today.

00:27:53.971 --> 00:27:55.839
That kid was not normal.

00:27:55.872 --> 00:27:58.677
I mean, that sound he made?

00:27:58.709 --> 00:28:00.764
That was not normal.

00:28:01.845 --> 00:28:03.528
And I don't even have a motive for him.

00:28:03.553 --> 00:28:04.965
I mean, maybe he didn't
know what he was doing.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:09.763
Maybe he isn't quite,
you know, all there.

00:28:09.795 --> 00:28:11.965
Hey, hey, something might
have happened to him.

00:28:11.998 --> 00:28:14.066
What in the hell are you guys doing?

00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:16.568
- Food is in here.
- All right.

00:28:16.602 --> 00:28:17.703
Hey, Jack.

00:28:17.743 --> 00:28:20.115
Hey, Ambrose finally comes home.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.089
- Where's the freaking parade?
- Yeah.

00:28:22.114 --> 00:28:23.510
You're still spending the night, right?

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:27.196
- Yeah, uh, it's still okay?
- No, no, no, it's good.

00:28:27.221 --> 00:28:28.287
- It's good.
- Yeah, okay.

00:28:28.314 --> 00:28:29.883
Hey, Jean, this is the Keller old boy

00:28:29.915 --> 00:28:31.884
I was telling you about. Harry Ambrose.

00:28:31.918 --> 00:28:33.686
Look at that hair. Here, give me this.

00:28:33.719 --> 00:28:36.321
- Welcome back.
- Uh, Dad, I got your beer.

00:28:36.346 --> 00:28:37.957
- Good.
- And the dish soap.

00:28:37.989 --> 00:28:39.322
Good, good, good. Get in.

00:28:39.365 --> 00:28:40.834
I've got dinner on the stove.

00:28:46.639 --> 00:28:48.641
- Why's he just looking at his food?
- I dunno.

00:28:48.668 --> 00:28:50.036
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:28:50.068 --> 00:28:51.537
- Eat your food, man.
- Eat your food.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.539
Food goes in your mouth.
You don't stare at it.

00:28:53.573 --> 00:28:56.142
Wanna play fetch? You're a dog.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.652
<i>What happened when you were outside?</i>

00:29:08.688 --> 00:29:10.189
<i>Julian?</i>

00:29:12.223 --> 00:29:15.332
I was walking back
from the barn with Vish.

00:29:15.595 --> 00:29:17.130
And what did you do?

00:29:21.066 --> 00:29:22.634
I didn't do anything.

00:29:24.135 --> 00:29:25.771
Julian.

00:29:25.892 --> 00:29:28.080
He took my stick away.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.676
And why did he do that?

00:29:31.242 --> 00:29:33.659
- Because.
- Because?

00:29:34.313 --> 00:29:35.715
Because what?

00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.084
He didn't want me hitting the fence.

00:29:38.116 --> 00:29:40.018
And he took it.

00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:43.155
He's taller than me,
so I couldn't reach it.

00:29:43.189 --> 00:29:46.326
And then what happened?

00:29:46.358 --> 00:29:48.260
Julian? What happened?

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.804
I became Shadow Julian.

00:30:00.772 --> 00:30:03.108
And what are you supposed
to do when that happens?

00:30:05.678 --> 00:30:06.779
Julian?

00:30:09.749 --> 00:30:12.679
Should have seen those bodies.

00:30:12.751 --> 00:30:15.338
Wouldn't think a kid would do that.

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:19.854
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
What those parents did?

00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:22.219
Your own kid killing you?

00:30:23.129 --> 00:30:25.291
I look at him, and I...

00:30:25.765 --> 00:30:27.720
I get this feeling.

00:30:30.068 --> 00:30:32.238
- I don't know.
- How old is he, again?

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.139
13. Looks younger.

00:30:34.172 --> 00:30:36.675
Well, you're old enough
to know what murder is at 13.

00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:39.012
There's no doubt about that.

00:30:39.147 --> 00:30:40.514
13.

00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:44.376
We were blowing up lamp posts
at 13, remember?

00:30:44.401 --> 00:30:46.470
Lamp posts?

00:30:46.504 --> 00:30:48.988
- The Damianos.
- Uh...

00:30:49.172 --> 00:30:51.742
You had all that, uh, gunpowder

00:30:51.776 --> 00:30:54.033
and we blew up their light.

00:30:54.106 --> 00:30:57.076
- They called the cops.
- Really?

00:30:58.248 --> 00:30:59.851
How do you not remember that?

00:30:59.883 --> 00:31:02.753
Those years are... there's
all kind of a wash, I guess.

00:31:02.786 --> 00:31:04.521
Harry, there was an explosion.

00:31:04.555 --> 00:31:06.891
People remember explosions.

00:31:25.308 --> 00:31:27.310
I'm sorry to hear about you and Faye.

00:31:27.343 --> 00:31:29.134
- It's all right.
- It's tough.

00:31:29.174 --> 00:31:31.242
No...

00:31:31.347 --> 00:31:34.284
It's all right, uh...

00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:39.222
I still see Melanie
and my grandson, Eli.

00:31:39.256 --> 00:31:42.293
- Eli? Good.
- Yeah, it's all the company I need.

00:31:42.325 --> 00:31:43.580
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:48.219
I appreciate you helping
Heather out with this thing.

00:31:48.364 --> 00:31:51.457
- She doing okay?
- Oh, yeah.

00:31:51.602 --> 00:31:53.271
She's got a good handle on it.

00:31:53.304 --> 00:31:55.172
She worries a lot.

00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:56.808
But she's a good girl.

00:31:56.841 --> 00:31:58.309
Oh, yeah.

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:01.025
She's gay. Did she tell you?

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.897
- No.
- Yeah, she, uh...

00:32:05.949 --> 00:32:08.969
She came out to me a few years ago.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.269
How was that?

00:32:11.421 --> 00:32:13.891
Great. Great.

00:32:13.923 --> 00:32:15.325
It's not getting in her way, man.

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:18.329
She's, uh... hey, she's a go-getter.

00:32:18.362 --> 00:32:19.497
Like her mom.

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:28.346
- I'm gonna head home.
- No, no, no.

00:32:28.372 --> 00:32:29.574
Sit with us for a while, please.

00:32:29.606 --> 00:32:31.908
I need to crash. Meet me at the station?

00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:33.343
- 10:00?
- Yep, yeah.

00:32:33.376 --> 00:32:35.045
Isn't she beautiful? Look at her.

00:32:35.078 --> 00:32:36.613
All right, um, don't tell
anyone about the case

00:32:36.647 --> 00:32:39.050
- at the restaurant, okay?
- No, I won't.

00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:42.320
And you're running out of toilet paper.

00:32:42.353 --> 00:32:44.389
- Make me a list, please.
- All right.

00:32:45.622 --> 00:32:46.990
Good night. Be safe.

00:32:47.024 --> 00:32:48.626
Good night.

00:32:48.659 --> 00:32:49.904
Good night.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.536
Let me know if you need
any local recommendations.

00:33:32.568 --> 00:33:33.732
Hi.

00:33:33.757 --> 00:33:36.007
Mr. Patel, we're all done with the room.

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:38.408
- Do you have a few minutes?
- Sure.

00:33:38.441 --> 00:33:40.411
- This is Detective Ambrose.
- How you doing?

00:33:40.443 --> 00:33:42.638
You mentioned you'd seen him
that morning?

00:33:42.663 --> 00:33:44.415
Uh, yeah, yeah. I only saw him once.

00:33:44.448 --> 00:33:45.765
You see, I was here at the desk.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.652
Uh, and I wanted to use the bathroom.

00:33:48.686 --> 00:33:51.322
So I came in over here.

00:33:52.589 --> 00:33:55.359
Uh, see, this is where we
set up the breakfast bar, uh,

00:33:55.391 --> 00:33:57.361
in the morning, 7:00 to 10:00.

00:33:57.393 --> 00:33:59.930
I saw the kid standing right there.

00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:04.716
Found it a bit strange that
the kid was trying to make tea.

00:34:06.226 --> 00:34:08.639
But then I said maybe
because he was sick.

00:34:08.671 --> 00:34:10.341
Sick?

00:34:10.373 --> 00:34:12.475
What do you mean, sick?

00:34:12.509 --> 00:34:15.947
Well, he had bunch
of tissues in his hands.

00:34:18.082 --> 00:34:21.018
<i>And I was worried that
he was gonna touch bagels.</i>

00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:22.748
You were out at the desk.

00:34:22.773 --> 00:34:25.228
When was it he came in?

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.196
I didn't see him come in.

00:34:27.357 --> 00:34:29.359
He must have come through the back door.

00:34:35.598 --> 00:34:37.854
So I found the sneakers over there.

00:35:05.129 --> 00:35:07.162
You know what this is?

00:35:07.698 --> 00:35:09.567
Jimson Weed.

00:35:10.533 --> 00:35:11.904
It's an amazing plant.

00:35:11.984 --> 00:35:15.372
It grows in backyards, in the woods,

00:35:15.439 --> 00:35:19.555
along roads. The flowers are really...

00:35:20.362 --> 00:35:22.498
They smell good.

00:35:25.482 --> 00:35:26.617
Here.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.556
Yeah.

00:35:34.058 --> 00:35:36.460
Most people wouldn't have a clue,

00:35:36.493 --> 00:35:38.529
but you know exactly what would happen

00:35:38.562 --> 00:35:41.132
if you touched that plant, don't you?

00:35:42.698 --> 00:35:45.265
After a couple of hours,

00:35:45.891 --> 00:35:48.242
your skin's gonna break out.

00:35:48.672 --> 00:35:49.861
Like this.

00:35:50.758 --> 00:35:56.458
And if you eat it or if you
drink a tea made from it,

00:35:56.814 --> 00:35:58.116
it'll kill you.

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:04.464
You went out behind the motel
and picked some leaves.

00:36:05.154 --> 00:36:09.504
<i>And then you steeped
the leaves in hot water.</i>

00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:12.495
That right?

00:36:16.834 --> 00:36:18.169
Yeah.

00:36:20.603 --> 00:36:22.172
And then what did you do?

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.727
You were upset.

00:36:28.862 --> 00:36:32.774
You wanted to make things
better however you could.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:34.218
Right?

00:36:41.257 --> 00:36:42.725
I gave it to them.

00:36:45.629 --> 00:36:46.831
To your parents?

00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:51.735
And you knew what would
happen when they drank it?

00:36:54.981 --> 00:36:57.521
Yes.

00:37:02.613 --> 00:37:05.216
Why did you want them to drink it?

00:37:08.117 --> 00:37:09.185
Julian.

00:37:11.254 --> 00:37:13.189
They're gonna press charges against you

00:37:13.223 --> 00:37:14.658
and it's gonna get harder.

00:37:14.992 --> 00:37:18.381
There's gonna be a lot
of new people around here.

00:37:18.794 --> 00:37:21.768
And not many of them are gonna listen.

00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:23.737
Now...

00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:27.337
Now is when I can help you.

00:37:28.689 --> 00:37:30.507
If you try to tell me.

00:37:33.343 --> 00:37:34.777
My mother...

00:37:36.879 --> 00:37:39.249
What about your mother?

00:37:59.203 --> 00:38:00.704
Julian.

00:38:04.975 --> 00:38:07.310
Why can't I just go home?

00:38:13.598 --> 00:38:15.027
Jesus.

00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:18.801
Well, I have to say this is a first.

00:38:18.826 --> 00:38:22.429
We have a confession and
enough circumstantial evidence.

00:38:22.462 --> 00:38:25.499
We could file charges now.

00:38:25.532 --> 00:38:27.768
Well, I see he's been
assigned a public defender.

00:38:27.802 --> 00:38:28.803
No next of kin?

00:38:28.835 --> 00:38:30.337
He says he doesn't have any.

00:38:30.371 --> 00:38:32.307
We haven't been able
to track anyone down.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.508
Does he seem disturbed?

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.410
Are we dealing with psychosis here?

00:38:36.444 --> 00:38:38.054
We're not sure.

00:38:38.086 --> 00:38:39.654
Sign of the times, huh?

00:38:39.686 --> 00:38:41.822
Our own kids coming after us.

00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:45.060
You realize it's gonna be
a circus once you file this?

00:38:45.093 --> 00:38:46.628
Get ready.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.609
Oh, I got a lunch.

00:38:48.634 --> 00:38:50.905
- Good seeing you, Detective.
- See you.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:53.200
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, you, too, Detective.

00:38:55.302 --> 00:38:57.171
This is family court.

00:38:57.456 --> 00:38:59.058
Once you file the charges,
you have three days

00:38:59.083 --> 00:39:01.519
until the court date.
So what are we gonna do?

00:39:01.545 --> 00:39:03.514
We gotta wait.

00:39:03.547 --> 00:39:05.815
We don't have the toxicology back yet.

00:39:05.849 --> 00:39:07.985
We need more time with him
before we start

00:39:08.018 --> 00:39:09.453
that whole process.

00:39:10.954 --> 00:39:12.290
Right?

00:39:14.023 --> 00:39:15.058
Right.

00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:26.325
So I guess this means
you're staying on for a bit.

00:39:26.436 --> 00:39:30.303
Yeah, yeah, I thought so.
If you don't mind.

00:39:30.366 --> 00:39:32.408
No, no, that sounds good.

00:39:35.045 --> 00:39:37.380
So how'd you end up in Dorchester?

00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:41.117
You mean why did I leave here?

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.518
Yeah.

00:39:44.688 --> 00:39:47.057
This area is...

00:39:49.584 --> 00:39:53.915
You know, in the 1800s, it was
swarming with Evangelicals.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.518
Joseph Smith saw God, started Mormonism.

00:39:57.601 --> 00:40:00.660
Spiritualists talking to the dead.

00:40:00.716 --> 00:40:04.121
The Burned Over District,
they called it.

00:40:04.861 --> 00:40:06.997
There's something in the soil here.

00:40:09.478 --> 00:40:11.114
Things won't stay quiet.

00:40:24.324 --> 00:40:26.163
Julian, lights out in five minutes.

00:40:34.372 --> 00:40:35.672
Why do you feel so bad?

00:40:38.474 --> 00:40:40.511
- 'Cause I hurt Vish.
- That's true.

00:40:42.283 --> 00:40:45.220
But we talked about this, didn't we?

00:40:45.298 --> 00:40:47.466
When you push those feelings away,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.405
they just get stronger.

00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:55.592
Shadow Julian is Julian. He's you.

00:40:57.561 --> 00:40:59.896
And when he comes knocking,
what are you supposed to do?

00:41:02.865 --> 00:41:04.457
I let him in.

00:41:05.082 --> 00:41:06.383
That's right.

00:41:38.701 --> 00:41:40.269
<i>Mom, I got some!</i>

00:41:46.141 --> 00:41:47.143
Mom?

00:42:28.217 --> 00:42:30.553
We found the victim's car.

00:42:30.587 --> 00:42:33.062
At an orchard on Route 6.

00:42:33.623 --> 00:42:36.721
We found the mother's wallet, but no ID.

00:42:37.095 --> 00:42:38.597
Who these days has no ID?

00:42:38.678 --> 00:42:40.758
<i>Yeah, that's strange.</i>

00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:43.647
We're towing the car in.
Meet me at the station?

00:42:43.744 --> 00:42:45.680
Yeah, sounds good.

00:42:47.454 --> 00:42:48.823
I gotta go.

00:42:48.885 --> 00:42:51.107
Your daughter's hot on the trail.

00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:54.851
- Can I get that to go?
- I'll go get it packed up.

00:42:54.878 --> 00:42:56.646
What's the damage here?

00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:58.281
- Harry, it's on the house.
- Oh, no, no.

00:42:58.315 --> 00:43:00.183
- I gotta paid for it.
- I'm not taking your money.

00:43:00.215 --> 00:43:02.450
Well, I'm not taking your food for free.

00:43:02.522 --> 00:43:03.686
Now you're being an idiot.

00:43:04.188 --> 00:43:07.172
Just, here.

00:43:07.213 --> 00:43:10.323
Harry, what is this?
I thought we were friends.

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:11.728
Yeah, we are.

00:43:13.762 --> 00:43:15.514
Now take your goddamn money.

00:43:18.153 --> 00:43:19.649
All right.

00:43:21.337 --> 00:43:23.072
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

00:43:25.875 --> 00:43:29.547
One shirt, blue. Looks like a woman's.

00:43:29.978 --> 00:43:32.448
Okay, wallet. Pair of women's underwear.

00:43:32.513 --> 00:43:33.721
Beige.

00:43:33.761 --> 00:43:35.819
So we got the plates.

00:43:35.851 --> 00:43:38.788
The car pulled into the parking
lot, the luggage...

00:43:38.822 --> 00:43:40.857
See these front tires?

00:43:40.889 --> 00:43:43.125
They're turning to the right.

00:43:43.159 --> 00:43:44.695
- Yeah.
- If they were going

00:43:44.728 --> 00:43:45.862
to Niagara Falls,
they couldn't have been coming

00:43:45.895 --> 00:43:46.996
from Pennsylvania.

00:43:47.021 --> 00:43:50.333
They were driving down toward I-90.

00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:52.054
From this county.

00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:53.670
They were coming from the north.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.507
What exactly are we looking for, here?

00:44:13.674 --> 00:44:15.176
I don't know.

00:44:15.257 --> 00:44:17.333
Something.

00:44:17.393 --> 00:44:18.761
Anything.

00:44:21.398 --> 00:44:23.300
All right, you guys want some lunch?

00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:27.704
Hey, Brick, are these all
the bags that were in the car?

00:44:27.737 --> 00:44:29.239
Yeah.

00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:31.273
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

00:44:31.306 --> 00:44:33.176
Just the canvas and the duffel.

00:44:34.744 --> 00:44:37.856
Then where are all Julian's things?

00:44:38.144 --> 00:44:40.715
Do you see a kid's toothbrush anywhere?

00:44:40.884 --> 00:44:42.690
No.

00:44:42.786 --> 00:44:45.661
- Kid's underwear?
- No.

00:44:45.755 --> 00:44:47.291
T-shirt, socks?

00:44:49.192 --> 00:44:50.293
Oh, my God.

00:44:52.395 --> 00:44:54.965
What kind of parents go on
a trip and don't pack a bag

00:44:54.998 --> 00:44:56.166
for their kid?

00:44:57.933 --> 00:45:00.529
What were they planning
on doing with him?

00:45:23.248 --> 00:45:25.583
Excuse me, I'm here about the incident

00:45:25.626 --> 00:45:27.762
at the Rockford Lodge Motel.

00:45:29.228 --> 00:45:30.512
How may I help you?

00:45:30.537 --> 00:45:32.132
The boy who was taken into custody,

00:45:32.187 --> 00:45:33.818
I need to know where he's being held.

00:45:33.843 --> 00:45:36.163
And this is regarding what, ma'am?

00:45:37.304 --> 00:45:38.673
I'm his mother.
