00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:19.731
Now I know what you're
thinking. "Oh, no!"

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.577
"Thor's in a cage. How did
this happen?" Well, sometimes,

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.747
you have to get captured just to
get a straight answer out of someone.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.510
Long story, basically
I'm a bit of a hero.

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:35.507
See, I spent some time on Earth.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:41.359
Fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching thru the cosmos for some...

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:44.314
Magic, colorful "Infinity Stone" things.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.276
Couldn't find any.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.241
That's when I came across
the path of death,

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:50.384
and destruction.

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:55.123
Which led me all the
way here, into this cage...

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.287
Where I met you.

00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:05.081
How much longer do you
think we'd be here?

00:01:17.963 --> 00:01:21.741
Thor, son of Odin.

00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:26.826
Surtur! You're still alive.

00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:29.558
I thought my father killed you. Like,

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:30.807
half a million years ago.

00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:32.686
I cannot die.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.687
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.

00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:41.390
It's funny you should mention that, because
I've been having these terrible dreams of late.

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:46.413
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and
you, Surtur, in the center of all of them.

00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:48.515
Then you can see Ragnarok.

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:51.483
The fall of Asgard.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:54.274
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on! Hang on.

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.176
I'll be back around shortly.

00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:01.165
I really feel like we
were connecting there.

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:07.054
Okay, so, Ragnarok.
Tell me about that.

00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:12.111
My time has come. When my crown is
reunited with the Eternal Flame...

00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:17.037
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains...

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:19.993
And bury my sword deep in Asgard...

00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:20.991
Hang on.

00:02:20.992 --> 00:02:22.896
Give it a second.

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:25.843
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.794
Everytime...

00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:30.807
Okay, so let me get this straight.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.563
You're gonna put your crown, in the Eternal Flame,
and then you suddenly grow as big as a house?

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:37.610
A mountain!

00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:40.699
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:43.633
Odin is not on Asgard.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.373
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:49.440
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:53.259
This is my crown. The
source of my power.

00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:56.308
Oh, that's a crown? I thought
it was a big eyebrow.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.187
It's a crown.

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:04.194
Anyway, It sounds like to stop Ragnarok,
I just rip that thing off your head?

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:07.225
But Ragnarok has already begun.

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:10.152
You cannot stop it.

00:03:18.893 --> 00:03:20.101
I am Asgard's doom.

00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:25.755
And so are you. All will suffer.
All will burn!

00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:26.969
That's intense.

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:32.689
To be honest, seeing you grow really big and
set fire to a planet would be quite a spectacle.

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:36.626
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose
option B, where I bust out of these chains...

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.602
Knock that tiara off your head, and
stash it away in Asgard's vault.

00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:43.627
You can not stop Ragnarok.

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:44.713
Why fight it?

00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:49.449
Because, that's what heroes do.

00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:56.408
Wait, I'm sorry. I
didn't time that right.

00:03:57.438 --> 00:03:59.499
And now!

00:04:03.287 --> 00:04:07.129
You have made a grave
mistake, Odinson.

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:10.213
I make grave mistakes all the time.

00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:15.050
Everything seems to work out.

00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:32.908
Heimdall, I know it's been a while...

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:35.789
but I could really use a fast exit!

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:37.918
Heimdall?

00:05:38.878 --> 00:05:40.839
Heimdall was an idiot.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.742
This job should've made him rich.

00:05:43.775 --> 00:05:47.617
The job ain't easy, but it
does have its benefits.

00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:51.653
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:54.709
I mean it's all mine for the taking.

00:05:55.572 --> 00:05:57.666
Behold...

00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:00.633
My stuff.

00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:07.398
I'm particularly fond of these. I pulled them
out of a place in Midgard called Tehk-Sas.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:11.368
I even named them Des and Troy.

00:06:11.378 --> 00:06:14.360
You see, when you put them together...

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:17.121
They destroy.

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:36.973
Heimdall? Come on.

00:06:55.773 --> 00:06:57.644
Stay!

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.501
Heimdall?

00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:02.533
I'm running short of options.

00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:04.413
Heimdalll?

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.404
Skurge...

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.437
Is that important?

00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:20.353
You girls are in for a treat.

00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:13.389
Girls!

00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:16.339
Well, well, well.

00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:18.442
Look who decided to pop in.

00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:20.320
Thanks for scaring away my company

00:08:20.323 --> 00:08:22.283
and drenching the
workplace with brains.

00:08:22.327 --> 00:08:23.280
Who are you?

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.323
Don't you remember?

00:08:24.364 --> 00:08:26.359
I'm Skurge, we've
fought together

00:08:26.403 --> 00:08:28.239
- on Vanaheim.
- Right.

00:08:28.276 --> 00:08:29.285
Where is Heimdall?

00:08:29.296 --> 00:08:32.309
That traitor? Well, no one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:33.439
Traitor?

00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:38.773
See, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence
of duty but disappeared before the trial.

00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:41.147
Hard to catch a guy who
can see everything.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.965
Hold on. I'm supposed to
announce your arrival.

00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:10.558
What the hell is that?

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:20.481
Oh, Brother...

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:22.452
This is it.

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:25.286
- I take my leave.
- You fool!

00:09:25.289 --> 00:09:27.283
- You didn't listen.
- I'm sorry.

00:09:27.294 --> 00:09:29.165
- Lady Sif, get help!
- Somebody, help!

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.227
I'm sorry for all I've done.

00:09:31.268 --> 00:09:33.106
Shhh.

00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:36.089
- It's all right. Hold on.
- I'm sorry.

00:09:36.132 --> 00:09:37.949
I tried to rule Earth.

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:41.252
- They'd be lucky to have you.
- I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.096
I just couldn't help myself.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.119
- I'm a trickster.
- Yes, so mischievious.

00:09:46.198 --> 00:09:48.914
Sorry when I turned
you to a frog.

00:09:48.915 --> 00:09:50.225
It was a wonderful joke.

00:09:50.336 --> 00:09:52.971
It was indeed hilarious.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.404
You are the saviour of Asgard.

00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:58.253
Tell my story. Build a statue for me.

00:09:58.367 --> 00:10:00.585
We will build a big statue for you.

00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:04.017
With my helmet on. With
the big, bendy horns.

00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:06.912
I will tell father what
you did here today.

00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:08.967
I didn't do it for him.

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:11.049
I didn't do it...

00:10:11.097 --> 00:10:12.652
for him.

00:10:19.673 --> 00:10:25.522
No!

00:10:26.773 --> 00:10:29.638
And so, Loki died of his wounds.

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.948
Giving his life for ours.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.259
He fought back those disgusting elves.

00:10:34.306 --> 00:10:36.995
He brought peace to the realm.

00:10:37.025 --> 00:10:38.674
Loki, my boy...

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:41.437
T'was many moons ago, when
I found you on that...

00:10:41.462 --> 00:10:43.619
Frostbitten battlefield.

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:48.401
On that day, I did not yet
see in you, Asgard's savior.

00:10:48.442 --> 00:10:53.392
No. You were merely, a
little blue baby

00:10:53.434 --> 00:10:57.932
icicle that melted,
this old fool's heart.

00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:02.222
Bravo. Bravo.

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:07.715
Father.

00:11:07.912 --> 00:11:09.715
Oh, shit.

00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:13.685
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.

00:11:14.552 --> 00:11:16.650
That's an interesting play.
What's it called?

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.635
The tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.688
People wanted to commemmorate him.

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:23.621
And indeed they should.
Oh, I like the statue.

00:11:23.655 --> 00:11:29.334
Looked better-looking than him when he was
alive. A little less weasely, less greasy maybe.

00:11:29.437 --> 00:11:31.565
You know what this is?

00:11:31.572 --> 00:11:34.497
Oh, the skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:40.379
Do me a favor. Lock this away in the
vault so it doesn't destroy the planet.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:42.242
Thank you, dear.

00:11:42.287 --> 00:11:46.097
Um, so, it's back to
Midgard for you, is it?

00:11:46.098 --> 00:11:47.240
Nope.

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:50.171
You know I've been having
this recurring dream lately.

00:11:50.172 --> 00:11:53.139
Every night I'd see
Asgard falling to ruins.

00:11:53.164 --> 00:11:57.006
That's just a silly dream. Signs
of an overactive imagination.

00:11:57.007 --> 00:11:57.960
Possibly.

00:11:57.961 --> 00:11:59.922
But then I decided to go
out there and investigate.

00:11:59.933 --> 00:12:03.933
And what do I find, but the 9
Realms completely in chaos.

00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:07.940
Enemies of Asgard assembling.
Plotting our demise, all while you,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.813
Odin, the protector of those 9 Realms, are
sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.

00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:15.602
Yes, well it is best to respect
our neighbor's freedom.

00:12:15.608 --> 00:12:16.582
Yes, of course.

00:12:16.626 --> 00:12:18.855
The freedom to be massacred.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.092
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself...

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:26.290
- Watching theater?
- No. Board meetings, security council meetings...

00:12:26.315 --> 00:12:27.651
You're gonna really
make me do it?

00:12:27.676 --> 00:12:28.875
Do what?

00:12:31.545 --> 00:12:35.500
You know that nothing will stop
Mjolnir as it returns to my hand...

00:12:35.525 --> 00:12:36.690
Not even your face.

00:12:36.727 --> 00:12:38.462
You've gone quite mad.

00:12:38.487 --> 00:12:39.968
You will be executed for this.

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.794
Then I'll see you on the
other side, brother.

00:12:43.306 --> 00:12:45.360
All right. I yield!

00:12:54.154 --> 00:12:56.114
Behold!

00:12:56.254 --> 00:12:59.080
Thor Odinson.

00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:00.950
No.

00:13:01.974 --> 00:13:03.014
You had one job.

00:13:03.057 --> 00:13:04.895
Just the one!

00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:06.859
Where is Odin?

00:13:06.872 --> 00:13:08.808
You just couldn't
stay away, could you?

00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:10.835
Everything was fine without you.

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:13.890
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.915
- Ask them...
- Where's Father? You kill him?

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.980
You had what you wanted. You had
the independence you asked for.

00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:21.947
Okay, I know exactly
where he is.

00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:35.625
I swear I left him right here.

00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:39.593
Here on the sidewalk, or that
building being demolished?

00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:41.536
- Great planning.
- How was I supposed to know?

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:43.407
I can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

00:13:43.409 --> 00:13:46.235
Really? Why did you
dress like one?

00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:48.206
- Hey!
- I can't believe you're alive.

00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:49.350
I saw you die.

00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:51.260
I mourned you, I cried for you.

00:13:51.293 --> 00:13:53.235
I'm honored.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.956
Hi, would you mind taking
a picture with us?

00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:57.676
Oh, sure.

00:13:58.133 --> 00:14:00.193
Start figuring out where he is.

00:14:01.155 --> 00:14:03.334
Sorry to hear that
Jane dumped you.

00:14:03.883 --> 00:14:05.975
She didn't dump me, though.

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:08.965
I dumped her. It was
a mutual dumping.

00:14:10.732 --> 00:14:12.288
What's this? What are you doing?

00:14:12.313 --> 00:14:13.980
This isn't me.

00:14:17.027 --> 00:14:18.863
Loki?

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:45.652
Thor Odinson.

00:14:55.553 --> 00:14:57.514
God of Thunder.

00:14:57.579 --> 00:15:00.433
You can put down the umbrella.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.239
So Earth has wizards now?

00:15:24.886 --> 00:15:28.816
I prefer the term Master of the
Mystic Arts. You can leave that now.

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:30.632
All right, wizard.

00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:32.572
Who are you and why should I care?

00:15:32.607 --> 00:15:36.642
My name is Dr. Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.588
Take a seat.

00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:43.605
Tea?

00:15:46.017 --> 00:15:47.788
I don't drink tea.

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:48.873
What do you drink?

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.838
Not tea.

00:15:53.282 --> 00:15:58.394
So I keep a watchlist of individuals from other
realms that may be a threat to this world.

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:02.319
Your adoptive brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:04.512
That's a worthy inclusion...

00:16:06.362 --> 00:16:08.266
Why bring him here?

00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:10.195
We're looking for my father.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.965
So if I were to tell
you where Odin was...

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.015
You all return to Asgard?

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.068
Promptly.

00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:19.087
Great. Then I'll help you.

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:21.936
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

00:16:21.961 --> 00:16:27.900
I have to tell you that he was adamant to not be
disturbed. He said he had chosen to remain in exile.

00:16:27.943 --> 00:16:30.734
And you don't have a phone.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.599
No, I don't have a phone, but you
could have sent an electronic letter.

00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:36.910
- Called an e-mail?
- Yeah. Do you have a computer?

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.609
No. What for?

00:16:38.656 --> 00:16:43.709
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile,
so if you could tell me where he is,

00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:46.867
- I can take him home.
- Gladly. He is in Norway.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:53.083
Let's see whether this incantation requires
any Asgardian modifications...

00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:54.718
Nope.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.319
Can you stop... doing that?

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.163
Can I... I need one
strand of your hair.

00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:11.312
Let me explain something. My
hair is not to be meddled with.

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:21.112
We could've just walked.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.056
He is waiting for you.

00:17:25.057 --> 00:17:26.825
All right.

00:17:26.862 --> 00:17:28.549
Oh, don't forget your umbrella.

00:17:28.604 --> 00:17:29.985
Oh, yes.

00:17:35.835 --> 00:17:38.848
Sorry...

00:17:43.449 --> 00:17:45.885
I suppose I need my brother back?

00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:47.563
Oh yeah, right.

00:17:52.527 --> 00:17:56.370
I have been falling,
for 30 minutes!

00:17:56.538 --> 00:17:58.372
You can handle him from here.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.451
Yes, yes.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.298
Thank you very much
for your help.

00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:04.447
- Good luck.
- Handle me? Who are you?

00:18:05.244 --> 00:18:07.692
- Loki...
- You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

00:18:07.717 --> 00:18:09.385
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

00:18:09.433 --> 00:18:10.751
All right. Bye-bye!

00:18:35.305 --> 00:18:36.916
Father.

00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:39.581
Look at this place.

00:18:39.636 --> 00:18:41.319
It's beautiful.

00:18:46.022 --> 00:18:47.982
Father, it's us.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.624
My sons.

00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:54.933
I've been waiting for you.

00:18:54.965 --> 00:18:57.044
I know. We've come
to take you home.

00:18:57.099 --> 00:18:58.820
Home? Yes.

00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:03.338
Your mother. She calls me.

00:19:04.492 --> 00:19:06.433
Can you hear it?

00:19:07.528 --> 00:19:09.588
Loki, lift your magic.

00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:14.250
It took me quite a while to
break free from your spell.

00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:16.192
Frigga would've been proud.

00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:19.117
Come sit with me, I
don't have much time.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:28.940
I know we've failed you, but
we can make this right.

00:19:28.974 --> 00:19:30.216
I failed you..

00:19:30.947 --> 00:19:32.884
It is upon us.

00:19:32.885 --> 00:19:33.926
Ragnarok.

00:19:33.969 --> 00:19:37.550
No, I've stopped Ragnarok,
I've put an end to Surtur.

00:19:37.598 --> 00:19:41.368
No, it's already begun. She's coming.

00:19:42.936 --> 00:19:46.738
My life has all but held her back,
but my time has come.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.773
I can not keep her
waiting any longer.

00:19:49.807 --> 00:19:52.598
Father .. Who are
you talking about?

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.644
Goddess of Death.

00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:56.018
Hela.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.585
My firstborn. Your sister.

00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:04.593
What?

00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:10.509
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:16.221
Couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

00:20:16.326 --> 00:20:20.260
Locked her away. She draws
her strength from Asgard.

00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:24.300
When she gets there, her
powers will be limitless.

00:20:24.344 --> 00:20:27.269
Whatever she is, we can
stop her together.

00:20:27.302 --> 00:20:29.171
No, we won't.

00:20:29.174 --> 00:20:31.554
I'm on a different path now.

00:20:31.602 --> 00:20:34.221
This you must face alone.

00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:37.946
I love you, my sons.

00:20:39.854 --> 00:20:40.997
Look at that.

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:50.550
Remember this place. Home.

00:21:28.768 --> 00:21:30.721
Brother.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.324
This was your doing.

00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:25.065
So he's gone?

00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:31.010
A shame. I would've
like to have seen that.

00:22:31.367 --> 00:22:33.629
You must be Hela.

00:22:33.717 --> 00:22:35.883
I'm Thor. Son of Odin.

00:22:35.923 --> 00:22:36.986
Really?

00:22:37.082 --> 00:22:39.178
You don't look like him.

00:22:39.242 --> 00:22:41.599
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

00:22:41.677 --> 00:22:43.502
You sound like him.

00:22:45.112 --> 00:22:46.802
Kneel.

00:22:46.897 --> 00:22:48.905
Beg your pardon?

00:22:50.841 --> 00:22:52.048
Kneel.

00:22:57.004 --> 00:22:59.011
For your queen.

00:22:59.828 --> 00:23:01.598
I don't think so.

00:23:11.822 --> 00:23:13.664
That's not possible.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.075
Darling, you have no
idea what's possible.

00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:41.701
- Bring us back!
- No!

00:23:49.508 --> 00:23:51.378
Loki!

00:24:36.356 --> 00:24:39.280
Who are you? What have
you done with Thor?

00:24:42.795 --> 00:24:44.701
I'm Hela.

00:24:45.835 --> 00:24:47.862
I'm just a janitor.

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:53.993
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

00:24:55.689 --> 00:24:58.479
How would you like a job?

00:27:05.538 --> 00:27:09.466
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?

00:27:09.877 --> 00:27:12.353
I'm just passing through.

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:15.091
It is food! On your knees.

00:27:56.344 --> 00:27:58.215
He's mine.

00:28:07.089 --> 00:28:08.959
Wait.

00:28:16.881 --> 00:28:17.990
Wait.

00:28:20.004 --> 00:28:24.833
He's mine. So if you want him,
you go through me.

00:28:24.834 --> 00:28:27.102
But we've already got him.

00:28:27.824 --> 00:28:30.873
All right then. I guess
I go through you.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.784
More food.

00:29:08.078 --> 00:29:09.254
Thank you.

00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:47.501
Scrapper 142, I need clearance
and an audience with boss.

00:29:47.545 --> 00:29:49.449
I've got someone special.

00:29:49.484 --> 00:29:52.406
Hey, where are you taking me?

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:54.469
Answer me!

00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:59.395
Hey! I'm Thor, son of Odin. I
need to get back to Asgard.

00:29:59.438 --> 00:30:02.230
Many apologies, Your Majesty.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.800
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

00:30:40.615 --> 00:30:43.797
I am Hela. Odin's firstborn.

00:30:43.802 --> 00:30:46.592
Commander of the Legions of Asgard.

00:30:46.594 --> 00:30:50.593
The rightful heir to the throne
and the Goddess of Death.

00:30:54.482 --> 00:30:56.611
My father is dead.

00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:59.473
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

00:30:59.477 --> 00:31:03.253
We were once the seat of
absolute power in the cosmos.

00:31:03.257 --> 00:31:08.376
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

00:31:08.413 --> 00:31:13.078
Our destiny is to
rule over all others.

00:31:13.115 --> 00:31:17.047
And I'm here to
restore that power.

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:19.026
Kneel before me.

00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:23.229
And rise to the ranks
of my great conquest.

00:31:24.188 --> 00:31:31.807
Whoever you are, whatever you've done.
Surrender now, or we will show no mercy.

00:31:31.846 --> 00:31:35.879
Whoever I am? Did you
listen to a word I've said?

00:31:35.888 --> 00:31:38.775
This is your last warning.

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:42.811
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

00:31:47.684 --> 00:31:49.588
Fine.

00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:59.445
I missed this.

00:32:59.482 --> 00:33:01.478
Still, it's a shame.

00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:03.549
Good soldiers dying for nothing.

00:33:03.593 --> 00:33:06.350
All because they
couldn't see the future.

00:33:06.386 --> 00:33:08.380
Sad.

00:33:09.308 --> 00:33:11.371
Still alive.

00:33:18.248 --> 00:33:20.185
Change of heart?

00:33:20.219 --> 00:33:23.267
Go back to whatever chamber
you crept out of...

00:33:23.275 --> 00:33:26.134
You evil demoness!

00:33:29.124 --> 00:33:32.014
Let's go see my palace.

00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:03.652
Fear not, for you are found.

00:34:05.632 --> 00:34:08.557
You're home and there's
no going back.

00:34:10.462 --> 00:34:12.457
No one leaves this place.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.561
But what is this place?

00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:16.531
The answer is ..

00:34:17.267 --> 00:34:19.226
Sakaar.

00:34:20.222 --> 00:34:22.251
Surrounded by cosmic gateways...

00:34:22.261 --> 00:34:25.207
Sakaar lives on the edge of
the known and unknown.

00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:29.216
It is the collection point for
all lost and unloved things.

00:34:29.227 --> 00:34:30.334
Like you.

00:34:30.343 --> 00:34:33.267
But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.012
You are valuable, cared, and loved.

00:34:37.015 --> 00:34:41.081
- What the hell?
- And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.

00:34:41.122 --> 00:34:45.849
He's the original. The first
lost, and the first found.

00:34:45.853 --> 00:34:49.920
The creator of Sakaar, and father
of the Contest of Champions.

00:34:49.961 --> 00:34:54.691
For once you were nothing,
now you are something.

00:34:54.727 --> 00:34:57.676
You are the property
of the Grandmaster.

00:34:57.719 --> 00:35:02.836
Congratulations, you will meet
the Grandmaster in 5 seconds.

00:35:02.844 --> 00:35:05.534
Prepare yourself.

00:35:06.524 --> 00:35:08.486
Prepare yourself.

00:35:09.449 --> 00:35:13.348
You are now meeting,
the Grandmaster.

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:29.254
- He's wonderful. It is a he?
- It is a he.

00:35:29.362 --> 00:35:33.330
I love it when you come to visit, 142.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:41.099
You bring me just the best stuff. Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz, about 142, what do I always say?

00:35:41.132 --> 00:35:43.717
- She is the, starts with a B...
- Trash.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.129
No. Not trash.

00:35:46.613 --> 00:35:48.910
Were you waiting to just call her that?

00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:51.479
- That doesnt start with a B.
- Boozehead.

00:35:52.403 --> 00:35:56.730
I'm sorry. No. Best. I
was thinking about best.

00:35:56.736 --> 00:35:57.979
'Cause I always say
you're the best.

00:35:57.984 --> 00:35:59.922
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

00:35:59.956 --> 00:36:02.878
- You say that everytime she's here.
- What have you brought today?

00:36:02.878 --> 00:36:08.110
- A contender.
- What? I need to go closer. I want a look at this.

00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:10.054
Can you take us
closer? Thank you.

00:36:21.918 --> 00:36:23.699
Pay this lady.

00:36:23.724 --> 00:36:27.850
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.176
Man, he's a fighter.

00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:37.581
I'll take 10 million.

00:36:37.606 --> 00:36:41.098
- Tell her she's dreaming.
- For heaven's sakes. Transfer the units.

00:36:47.919 --> 00:36:50.882
- You'll pay for this!
- No. I got paid for this.

00:36:51.754 --> 00:36:53.911
Here's what I want to know.

00:36:55.514 --> 00:37:01.858
- Who are you?
- I am the God of... Thunder!

00:37:01.897 --> 00:37:05.830
I didn't hear any thunder,
but on your fingers...

00:37:05.874 --> 00:37:08.651
Is that, like, sparkles?

00:37:08.691 --> 00:37:11.847
- We've located your cousin.
- Uh... Oh, good!

00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:13.524
Yeah, come on.

00:37:13.563 --> 00:37:14.927
You're gonna like this.

00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:17.603
There he is. Hey, cuz.

00:37:17.638 --> 00:37:19.673
It's been fun. Where
you been hiding?

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.699
Hi.

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.191
So...

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.625
- Sorry.
- Carlo...

00:37:29.974 --> 00:37:32.726
- I pardon you.
- Thank you.

00:37:33.488 --> 00:37:37.923
You're officially pardoned...
from life.

00:37:43.608 --> 00:37:47.544
Oh my God!

00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:50.802
I'm stepping in it!
Look.

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:53.844
- Oh, the smell.
- Wow!

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.680
- What does it smell like?
- Baked toast.

00:37:58.188 --> 00:38:01.822
What happened to my manners. I
haven't properly introduced myself.

00:38:01.847 --> 00:38:03.927
Come on. Follow me.

00:38:03.938 --> 00:38:09.878
My name is Grandmaster. I preside
over the Contest of Champions.

00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:13.632
Skip that part, why I don't participate
in it and you, my friend...

00:38:13.657 --> 00:38:16.592
Have just been part of the cast.
What do you say to that?

00:38:16.623 --> 00:38:20.213
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games. I'm going back to Asgard.

00:38:20.633 --> 00:38:24.628
Ass-guard?
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:38:27.985 --> 00:38:31.497
I let go.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.376
Loki? Loki!

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.747
Loki. Over here.

00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:39.502
Over here.

00:38:40.003 --> 00:38:41.576
Loki!

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:44.334
What? You're alive?

00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:47.730
- Of course, I'm alive! What are you doing here?
- What do you mean, what I'm doing?

00:38:47.762 --> 00:38:50.037
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
Where's your chair?

00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:51.504
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one.

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:53.156
- I can't.
- Get me out!

00:38:53.165 --> 00:38:57.062
I didn't just come to this place
without getting his favor.

00:38:57.074 --> 00:39:00.010
- Plus, I've been out here weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?

00:39:00.035 --> 00:39:02.136
- But I just got here.
- What are you wispering about?

00:39:02.136 --> 00:39:05.080
I'm a hip dude around these parts.

00:39:05.124 --> 00:39:09.409
On any other world, I'll be like, millions
of years old. But here on Sakaar...

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.798
In any case...

00:39:15.841 --> 00:39:18.229
You know this...

00:39:18.301 --> 00:39:21.888
- You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
- God of Thunder. Tell him.

00:39:21.989 --> 00:39:23.919
I've never met this
man in my life.

00:39:23.976 --> 00:39:25.671
- He's my brother!
- Adopted.

00:39:25.703 --> 00:39:28.900
- Is he any kind of a fighter?
- Take this thing off my neck. I'll show you.

00:39:28.925 --> 00:39:32.494
Listen to that. He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles! Here's the deal.

00:39:32.532 --> 00:39:35.455
- You wanna get back to Ass-place,  Ass-berg...
- Asgard!

00:39:35.455 --> 00:39:39.550
Any contender who
defeats my champion...

00:39:39.597 --> 00:39:42.111
- Their freedom they shall win.
- Fine!

00:39:42.136 --> 00:39:45.402
Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick.

00:39:45.446 --> 00:39:50.033
That's what I call contender! The
direction would be this way, Lord.

00:39:50.183 --> 00:39:51.360
Loki!

00:39:55.692 --> 00:39:59.192
Hey! Hey! Hey,
take it easy man.

00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:03.058
Over here. Pile of
rocks waving at you.

00:40:03.091 --> 00:40:06.968
Naw, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself...

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:10.086
My name is Korg. I'm kind of
like the leader in here...

00:40:10.126 --> 00:40:13.070
I'm made of rocks, as you can see,
but don't let that intimidate you.

00:40:13.081 --> 00:40:15.904
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.

00:40:15.909 --> 00:40:21.755
Just a little rock, paper, scissor
joke for you. This is my friend Miek.

00:40:21.922 --> 00:40:24.712
He's an insect and has
knives for hands.

00:40:24.714 --> 00:40:27.525
- You're a Kronnan, aren't you?
- That I am.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.389
How'd you end up in here?

00:40:29.421 --> 00:40:33.254
Well, I tried to start a revolution but
didn't print enough pamphlets, so...

00:40:33.279 --> 00:40:36.826
Hardly anyone turned up. Except for
my mum and her boyfriend who I hate.

00:40:36.858 --> 00:40:42.317
As punishment, I was forced to be in here and be a
gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

00:40:42.361 --> 00:40:48.515
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:52.252
How did you...

00:40:52.285 --> 00:40:55.299
Yeah, no. This whole
thing is a circle.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.231
But not a real circle.
More like a freaky circle.

00:40:58.232 --> 00:41:01.211
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here man.

00:41:01.222 --> 00:41:03.980
The only thing that does make
sense, is that nothing makes sense.

00:41:04.016 --> 00:41:06.594
Have anyone here fought the
Grandmaster's champion?

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:07.491
Doug has.

00:41:07.516 --> 00:41:10.979
Doug! Oh, right. Doug's dead.
That's right...

00:41:10.982 --> 00:41:13.926
Everyone who fights the
Grandmaster's champion perishes.

00:41:13.958 --> 00:41:15.899
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.787
Perishable rock, eh.

00:41:18.838 --> 00:41:22.623
Yeah, no. I just do the smaller fights.
Warm up the crowd and whatnot.

00:41:22.695 --> 00:41:26.171
- Wait, you're not gonna face him, are you?
- Yes, I am.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.916
I'm gonna fight him, win. Then
get the hell out of this place.

00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:33.662
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, New Doug.

00:41:41.491 --> 00:41:43.520
Does no one remember me?

00:41:43.555 --> 00:41:46.602
Has no one been
taught of history?

00:41:51.116 --> 00:41:53.144
Look at these lies.

00:41:53.169 --> 00:41:56.116
Goblets and garden parties?

00:41:57.136 --> 00:41:59.386
Peace treaties?

00:42:00.416 --> 00:42:03.430
Odin. Proud to have it...

00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:05.771
Shame now I've got it!

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.504
We were unstoppable.

00:42:25.566 --> 00:42:30.647
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.

00:42:32.828 --> 00:42:36.312
One by one, the
Realms became ours.

00:42:36.343 --> 00:42:39.665
But then, simply
because my ambition

00:42:39.707 --> 00:42:42.601
outgrew his... He banished me.

00:42:42.633 --> 00:42:45.577
Caged me. Locked me
away like an animal.

00:42:45.617 --> 00:42:52.505
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored. Their
bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.

00:43:03.212 --> 00:43:06.136
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake!

00:43:06.993 --> 00:43:09.651
Most of the stuff
in here is fake.

00:43:09.968 --> 00:43:11.963
Weak.

00:43:12.868 --> 00:43:15.169
Smaller than I thought it'd be.

00:43:16.503 --> 00:43:18.443
That's not bad.

00:43:18.755 --> 00:43:20.302
But this...

00:43:20.327 --> 00:43:23.409
The Eternal Flame.

00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:53.151
Want to see what true
power really looks like?

00:44:21.123 --> 00:44:25.164
Fenris, my darling. What
have they done to you?

00:44:26.132 --> 00:44:31.120
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn!

00:44:44.933 --> 00:44:47.790
I missed you.

00:44:47.934 --> 00:44:51.415
I missed you all.

00:44:53.193 --> 00:44:58.663
Odin, may you take your place
in the arms of Valhalla.

00:45:14.167 --> 00:45:16.939
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.

00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:21.172
Being told you're one thing, and
learning it's all a fiction.

00:45:24.876 --> 00:45:29.971
You didn't think I'd really come and see
you, did you? This place is disgusting.

00:45:32.377 --> 00:45:34.247
Does this mean you
don't want my help?

00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:37.966
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the
Grandmaster. It took me time to win his trust.

00:45:38.009 --> 00:45:40.063
He's a lunatic, but he
can be an awful one.

00:45:40.088 --> 00:45:42.104
What I'm telling you
is, you can join me

00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:47.182
at the Grandmaster's side. Perhaps in time, an
accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...

00:45:53.597 --> 00:45:55.793
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

00:45:58.573 --> 00:46:02.435
Our sister, destroyed your
hammer like a piece of glass.

00:46:02.776 --> 00:46:04.683
She's stronger than both of us.

00:46:04.709 --> 00:46:08.640
She's stronger than you. You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

00:46:13.335 --> 00:46:14.393
Fine.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:22.008
I guess I'll have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.

00:46:23.716 --> 00:46:25.675
Would you say something?

00:46:27.505 --> 00:46:29.213
Say something!

00:46:30.593 --> 00:46:33.317
What would you like me to say?

00:46:33.342 --> 00:46:35.370
You faked your own death.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.455
You stole the throne, stripped Odin of
his power, stranding him on Earth...

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.336
to die.

00:46:40.368 --> 00:46:45.320
Releasing the Goddess of Death. Have I said enough? Would
you like me to go back further than the past 2 days?

00:46:46.329 --> 00:46:48.916
You know I haven't seen this...

00:46:48.955 --> 00:46:53.375
What I've heard of the Champion he talks
of? I've heard he's astonishingly savage.

00:46:53.478 --> 00:46:58.239
I've placed a large wager against
you tomorrow. Don't let me down.

00:47:01.979 --> 00:47:03.917
Piss off, ghost!

00:47:05.732 --> 00:47:07.724
He's freaking gone.

00:47:15.534 --> 00:47:16.517
Oh, yuck!

00:47:16.526 --> 00:47:19.151
This got so much hair and blood all over.
Disgusting.

00:47:19.176 --> 00:47:23.464
Could you clean up the weapons, once you've
finished your fight? Disgusting slobs!

00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:25.282
Oh, Thor ..

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:27.376
Want to use a big wooden fork?

00:47:28.294 --> 00:47:30.257
- No.
- Yeah, not really useful.

00:47:30.282 --> 00:47:33.853
Unless you were fighting off 3
vampires that were huddled together.

00:47:34.472 --> 00:47:36.010
No, I really wish
I had my hammer.

00:47:36.035 --> 00:47:37.954
- Hammer?
- It's unique.

00:47:37.979 --> 00:47:41.724
It's made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.

00:47:41.749 --> 00:47:44.974
And when I spun it really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.

00:47:44.985 --> 00:47:46.854
- You rode the hammer?
- No. I...

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.134
I didn't ride the hammer.

00:47:48.159 --> 00:47:51.783
- The hammer rode you on your back?
- No, I spin it really fast

00:47:51.817 --> 00:47:54.012
- and it pulled me off..
- Oh, my god.

00:47:54.044 --> 00:47:57.721
- The hammer pulled you off?
- The ground! Pulled me off the ground. Up to the air.

00:47:57.765 --> 00:48:00.876
And I would fly. Everytime I
threw it, it would always

00:48:00.915 --> 00:48:02.391
come back to me.

00:48:02.416 --> 00:48:08.333
Sounds like you had a special relationship with this
hammer and losing it felt like losing a loved one.

00:48:08.358 --> 00:48:10.452
That's a nice way of putting it.

00:48:12.268 --> 00:48:14.298
I said they're mine.

00:48:14.325 --> 00:48:17.296
That's the one that
put me in here.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:21.174
Oh, yeah, Scrapper 142. Watch
out with those Asgardians, man.

00:48:21.199 --> 00:48:23.018
They are hard to push.

00:48:23.413 --> 00:48:24.950
Asgardian?

00:48:26.173 --> 00:48:28.198
Hey! Hey!

00:48:29.266 --> 00:48:30.307
Hey.

00:48:30.654 --> 00:48:33.931
Do not zap me with that thing!
I just want to talk.

00:48:34.045 --> 00:48:36.732
Asgard is in danger.

00:48:40.568 --> 00:48:42.362
My god, you are a Valkyrie.

00:48:42.418 --> 00:48:45.472
You know I used to wanna be a
Valkyrie when I was younger.

00:48:45.497 --> 00:48:48.993
Until I found out you were all women. There's
nothing wrong with women, of course.

00:48:49.028 --> 00:48:50.864
I love women.

00:48:50.901 --> 00:48:54.801
Sometimes a little too much. Not in
a creepy way, more of a respectful

00:48:54.813 --> 00:48:58.687
appreciation. I think it's great
that there's an elite force of women

00:48:58.722 --> 00:49:01.079
warriors in our time.

00:49:02.554 --> 00:49:03.649
Are you done?

00:49:03.684 --> 00:49:04.793
Lord of Thunder! You're up!

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.426
- Please help me. I need your help.
- Bye.

00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:11.386
Then you must be a traitor or a coward because
the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne.

00:49:12.647 --> 00:49:14.266
Listen closely, Your Majesty.

00:49:14.305 --> 00:49:18.182
This is Sakaar, not Asgard. And
I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

00:49:21.252 --> 00:49:22.294
Bring him in!

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:25.384
And no one escapes this place.

00:49:25.409 --> 00:49:27.436
So you're gonna die anyway.

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:42.635
Now don't you move. My hands aren't
as steady as they used to be.

00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:49.497
By Odin's beard you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath of the Mighty Thor!

00:49:53.026 --> 00:49:56.040
Please... Please kind
sir, don't cut my hair.

00:49:56.333 --> 00:50:00.140
Please... No! No!

00:50:13.334 --> 00:50:16.347
Great show! What a night!

00:50:16.538 --> 00:50:18.496
Please.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:26.358
I'm your host. Big round of applause for all the
competitors who today, died so gruesomely.

00:50:28.431 --> 00:50:33.725
What a show! What a night! This is
what you've come for, and so have I.

00:50:38.712 --> 00:50:44.494
And now, without further
ado, it's main event time.

00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:49.177
Making his first appearance...

00:50:55.257 --> 00:50:59.685
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.

00:51:22.288 --> 00:51:25.048
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparkles.

00:51:37.579 --> 00:51:41.349
He is a creature--- what
can you say about him?

00:51:41.389 --> 00:51:46.269
Well, he's unique. There's nothing like
him. I feel a sexual connection with him.

00:51:47.837 --> 00:51:49.794
He is undefeated...

00:51:50.704 --> 00:51:52.697
He's the reigning...

00:51:54.065 --> 00:51:56.161
He's the defending...

00:51:57.883 --> 00:52:00.987
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

00:52:04.847 --> 00:52:10.097
Your, Incredible...

00:52:14.175 --> 00:52:17.065
Yes!!!

00:52:19.486 --> 00:52:21.615
I have to get off this planet.

00:52:21.641 --> 00:52:24.712
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:36.127
Hey! Hey! We know each other!

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:38.675
He's a friend from work!

00:52:45.995 --> 00:52:50.732
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.

00:52:50.757 --> 00:52:54.561
So much has happened since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.157
Like yesterday, so that's
still pretty fresh. Loki...

00:52:59.229 --> 00:53:04.139
Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there. Loki! Look who it is!

00:53:06.144 --> 00:53:08.691
Oh, Banner, I'd never thought
I'd say this, but I...

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.531
I'm happy to see you.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:22.024
Banner! Hey, Banner!

00:53:22.318 --> 00:53:24.731
No Banner! Only Hulk!

00:53:25.041 --> 00:53:26.509
What are you doing?

00:53:26.534 --> 00:53:28.272
It's me...

00:53:28.297 --> 00:53:29.472
Thor!

00:53:48.064 --> 00:53:51.939
Banner, we're friends. This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you.

00:53:58.297 --> 00:54:00.425
Here we go. Here we go.

00:54:18.551 --> 00:54:20.458
What?

00:54:30.472 --> 00:54:33.043
Hey, big guy.

00:54:33.838 --> 00:54:36.003
The sun's getting real low...

00:54:46.675 --> 00:54:49.207
That's it. Sun's going down.

00:54:51.658 --> 00:54:55.556
I don't want to hurt you anymore.
No one will.

00:55:07.272 --> 00:55:10.287
Yes! That's how it feels!

00:55:10.553 --> 00:55:13.411
I'm just a huge fan
of this sport.

00:55:20.586 --> 00:55:23.442
All right... Screw it.

00:55:33.582 --> 00:55:36.506
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out.

00:55:45.481 --> 00:55:49.533
That's enough. You're embarassing me.
I told them we were friends!

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:21.881
Thunder! Thunder!

00:57:21.906 --> 00:57:26.893
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

00:57:26.918 --> 00:57:30.883
Thunder! Thunder!

00:57:30.908 --> 00:57:38.595
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

00:57:59.107 --> 00:58:02.086
Another day, another Doug.

00:58:09.401 --> 00:58:12.122
What is that noise?

00:58:12.186 --> 00:58:15.654
The common folk aren't
exactly falling in line.

00:58:15.741 --> 00:58:19.304
There's a resistance trying to
knock down the front gates.

00:58:24.189 --> 00:58:27.114
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

00:58:27.116 --> 00:58:29.723
Well, my dad was a stonemason,

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:34.500
Yeah, I'll stop you there. What I
meant was, what's your ambition?

00:58:35.944 --> 00:58:39.427
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

00:58:39.935 --> 00:58:45.276
Recognized. When I was young, every
great king had an executioner.

00:58:45.347 --> 00:58:51.055
Not just to execute people, but
also to execute their vision.

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:57.695
But mainly, to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.

00:58:59.773 --> 00:59:07.381
I was Odin's executioner. And
you shall be my executioner.

00:59:12.634 --> 00:59:15.748
Let's begin our conquest.

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:29.155
Skurge, where's the sword?

00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:36.324
The sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

00:59:36.475 --> 00:59:39.942
Those people you mentioned, the
ones who aren't falling in line.

00:59:40.617 --> 00:59:42.696
Round them up.

01:00:03.464 --> 01:00:05.558
Go on.

01:00:19.444 --> 01:00:22.309
Sorry about that, these
bloody things are everywhere.

01:00:22.428 --> 01:00:24.198
Come on.

01:00:58.143 --> 01:01:00.203
You will be safe here.

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:09.087
Are we cool?

01:02:11.679 --> 01:02:14.627
Hulk in a hot tub.

01:02:15.249 --> 01:02:18.296
- So how long have you been like that?
- Like what?

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:21.844
Like this. Big, green, stupid.

01:02:22.049 --> 01:02:24.859
Hulk always Hulk.

01:02:28.925 --> 01:02:30.901
How did you get here?

01:02:31.845 --> 01:02:34.230
- Winning.
- You mean cheating?

01:02:34.255 --> 01:02:37.023
Do they wear one of these?
When you won?

01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:39.610
How did you arrive here?

01:02:41.688 --> 01:02:45.568
- Quinjet.
- Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

01:02:49.874 --> 01:02:54.008
Ah, that's naked.
That's very naked.

01:02:57.047 --> 01:03:00.191
That's in my brain now.

01:03:00.342 --> 01:03:02.014
Quinjet.

01:03:11.085 --> 01:03:14.894
Yes, I'm getting us out of here.

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:18.965
This is terrible.
You'll love Asgard.

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:22.807
- It's big, golden, shiny.
- Hulk stay.

01:03:23.037 --> 01:03:26.203
No. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:29.908
- We must prevent Ragnarok.
- Ragnarok?

01:03:29.933 --> 01:03:34.408
Prophesied death of my homeworld.
The end of days. End of everything.

01:03:34.552 --> 01:03:37.171
If you help me to
get back to Asgard,

01:03:37.337 --> 01:03:41.368
- I can help you get back to earth.
- Earth hate Hulk.

01:03:41.424 --> 01:03:45.254
Earth loves Hulk. They love you. You're
one of the Avengers, one of the team.

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:47.849
That's what friends do,
support each other.

01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:52.023
- You're Banner's friend.
- I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:54.348
- Banner's friend.
- I don't even like Banner.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.618
I mean, the numbers,
and science and stuff.

01:03:56.645 --> 01:04:00.017
- Thor go, Hulk stay.
- Fine.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.549
Stay here. Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

01:04:04.581 --> 01:04:09.498
The red and the white?
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

01:04:09.553 --> 01:04:12.283
- Smash you.
- You didn't smash anything.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.188
- I won that fight.
- I smash you.

01:04:14.219 --> 01:04:16.497
- Yeah. Sure.
- Baby arms.

01:04:16.529 --> 01:04:21.449
- What?
- Baby! Thor go.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.515
Thor go again.

01:04:32.512 --> 01:04:34.605
Thor home.

01:04:44.043 --> 01:04:47.313
- Hulk trains.
- Great. Have fun.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:50.350
- Hey, big guy.
- Hey, little girl.

01:04:50.434 --> 01:04:52.913
- What are you up to?
- Winning.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:05.659
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

01:05:05.719 --> 01:05:09.618
I need you to help me.

01:05:09.643 --> 01:05:13.421
Help me see.

01:05:21.636 --> 01:05:24.650
I see you, but you're far away.

01:05:24.684 --> 01:05:27.874
- What's going on here?
- Come see for yourself.

01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:35.535
I provided refuge in a
stronghold built by ancestors.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.239
Our only escape is Bifrost.

01:05:37.264 --> 01:05:40.002
You're talking about
evacuating Asgard?

01:05:42.042 --> 01:05:44.896
We won't last long if we stay.

01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:48.920
She draws her power from Asgard and
grows stronger every day. Come on!

01:05:52.719 --> 01:05:57.636
Hela is madness. If I let her live, she'll
consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

01:05:57.703 --> 01:06:01.186
- We need you.
- I'm working on it, I don't even know where I am.

01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:03.859
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways.
Go thru one.

01:06:03.884 --> 01:06:06.598
- Which one?
- The big one.

01:06:33.367 --> 01:06:36.447
- Thor sad.
- Shut up.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.202
Thor sad!

01:06:41.227 --> 01:06:43.190
I'm not sad. Idiot.

01:06:43.518 --> 01:06:45.674
I'm pissed off.

01:06:45.729 --> 01:06:49.062
Angry. I lost my father.

01:06:49.101 --> 01:06:51.558
I lost my hammer.

01:06:51.606 --> 01:06:55.209
- Whine. Whine.
- You're not even listening!

01:06:55.365 --> 01:07:00.732
- Stop kick stuff!
- You're being a very bad friend!

01:07:00.757 --> 01:07:03.503
- You bad friend.
- Do you know what we call you?

01:07:03.528 --> 01:07:07.861
- We call you the stupid Avenger.
- You tiny Avenger!

01:07:10.551 --> 01:07:12.638
- What are you, crazy?
- Yes.

01:07:12.681 --> 01:07:16.437
You know what? Earth
does hate you.

01:07:40.086 --> 01:07:43.132
Sorry that I said those things.

01:07:43.157 --> 01:07:47.122
You are not the stupid Avenger,
nobody calls you that.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:48.983
It's okay.

01:07:49.017 --> 01:07:51.747
You just can't go around throwing
shields at people. You'll kill them.

01:07:51.778 --> 01:07:56.910
I know. It's just I get so angry
all the time. Always angry.

01:07:57.011 --> 01:08:01.079
We're the same. Just a couple
of hot-headed fools.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:06.006
Yes, same. Hulk like fire.
Thor like water.

01:08:06.412 --> 01:08:10.378
- We're kinda both like fire.
- But Hulk like real fire.

01:08:11.382 --> 01:08:18.115
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.

01:08:18.181 --> 01:08:21.890
Hulk, I need you to
do something for me.

01:08:25.423 --> 01:08:28.502
Hey, little girl.

01:08:36.003 --> 01:08:39.003
What's going on?
What are you...

01:08:46.873 --> 01:08:51.872
You're so thickheaded that you can't tell when someone
hiding across the universe wants to be left alone.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
- We need to talk.
- No, you won't talk to me.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
- I need her to stay here.
- Done.

01:09:00.611 --> 01:09:04.611
- Stay. Please?
- Please.

01:09:07.006 --> 01:09:09.006
All right.

01:09:09.009 --> 01:09:12.006
Here's the deal.

01:09:12.007 --> 01:09:14.008
I'll listen to you,

01:09:14.008 --> 01:09:17.007
until this is empty.

01:09:17.007 --> 01:09:22.004
Asgard is in danger. People are dying, we
need to get back there. I need your help.

01:09:23.006 --> 01:09:25.006
Finished. Bye.

01:09:27.004 --> 01:09:29.004
Odin is dead.

01:09:31.005 --> 01:09:34.004
Hela, the goddess of
death, has invaded Asgard.

01:09:34.005 --> 01:09:39.004
- If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.
- I'm going to stop her.

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:42.003
- Alone?
- Nope. I'm putting together a team.

01:09:42.003 --> 01:09:48.000
- It's me, you, and the big guy.
- No, no team! Only Hulk.

01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:52.000
- It's me and you.
- I think it's only you.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.001
The Valkyrie are a legend. Elite warriors
of Asgard, sworn to defend the throne.

01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:59.000
I'm not getting dragged into another
one of Odin's family squabbles.

01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:01.000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.008
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours. But grew beyond Odin's
control, she massacred everyone to try to seize the throne.

01:10:07.008 --> 01:10:11.009
When she tried to escape her banishment,
he sent the Valkyrie to fight her back.

01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:16.007
I only survived because...

01:10:16.007 --> 01:10:19.008
Look, I've already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne.

01:10:19.008 --> 01:10:22.008
It cost me everything. That's
what's wrong with Asgard.

01:10:22.008 --> 01:10:27.005
- The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.
- I agree.

01:10:27.007 --> 01:10:31.005
- Don't get familiar.
- I agree.

01:10:31.005 --> 01:10:36.003
That's why I turned down the throne. This
isn't about the crown. This is about the people.

01:10:36.004 --> 01:10:38.004
And they're dying, and
they're your people, too.

01:10:38.004 --> 01:10:40.005
Forget it.

01:10:40.005 --> 01:10:45.002
- I have.
- Okay. Good.

01:10:45.003 --> 01:10:48.003
- Thank you. For this.
- For what?

01:10:50.001 --> 01:10:52.003
You didn't see
that, did you?

01:10:52.003 --> 01:10:56.000
Well...

01:10:56.002 --> 01:11:02.001
Go ahead. Stay here and enslave
people for that lunatic.

01:11:02.002 --> 01:11:04.000
Keep drinking.
Keep hiding.

01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:10.009
Me, I choose to run toward my
problems, and not away from them.

01:11:11.009 --> 01:11:13.009
That's what---

01:11:17.009 --> 01:11:20.007
Because that's what heroes do.

01:11:31.005 --> 01:11:33.007
Friend, stay!

01:11:44.004 --> 01:11:46.003
Yes!

01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:08.001
Come on ..

01:12:08.001 --> 01:12:11.000

Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.

01:12:30.006 --> 01:12:32.008
Welcome,
Point Break.

01:12:34.007 --> 01:12:39.004
- Friend, stay!
- No, no. Don't!

01:12:39.007 --> 01:12:43.004
- Stay!
- No, stop breaking everything.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.774
Nice work, big guy.

01:12:47.837 --> 01:12:53.836
We don't know where Ultron's headed but you're going high
very fast, so I need you to turn this bird around, ok?

01:12:54.279 --> 01:12:56.281
We can't track you
in stealth mode, so,

01:12:56.337 --> 01:12:59.336
I need you to
help me out, okay?

01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:04.002
I need you...

01:13:18.009 --> 01:13:23.008
Hulk very bad!

01:13:28.355 --> 01:13:32.354
- What's this?
- Banner?

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.189
Are you all right? Banner?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.009
The sun's going down.
That's it. Breathe.

01:13:43.009 --> 01:13:48.114
- I won't hurt you. Sun's going down..
- Thor...

01:13:49.006 --> 01:13:52.006
- What happened to your hair?
- Some creepy old man cut it off.

01:13:52.006 --> 01:13:55.006
It looks good.
Where are we?

01:13:55.007 --> 01:13:59.005
- How's Nat?
- Uh, Nat is good.

01:13:59.183 --> 01:14:01.334
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

01:14:01.361 --> 01:14:03.953
- The city, Sokovia, did we save it?
- Banner, listen...

01:14:04.003 --> 01:14:06.584
- What?
- Sokovia, Ultron, that was 2 years ago.

01:14:06.806 --> 01:14:09.337
What are you saying?

01:14:10.003 --> 01:14:13.474
- I've been Hulk for 2 years?
- I'm afraid so.

01:14:19.003 --> 01:14:22.001
What the hell happened?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.009
Banner, there's something
you should know.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.001
- Voice activation required.
- Banner.

01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:32.009
- Welcome, Strongest Avenger.
- Uh, what?

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:36.000
Ship's log.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.008
- Thor, where are we?
- Yeah, about that...

01:14:47.008 --> 01:14:54.005
Sakaar. Hear ye. Attention, please. I have some
bad news. My beloved champion has gone missing.

01:14:54.006 --> 01:14:56.007
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.

01:14:57.005 --> 01:14:58.007
- Who's that?
- He kind of runs the place.

01:14:58.007 --> 01:15:01.006
You actually lived in
his house for a while.

01:15:01.006 --> 01:15:02.006
- I did?
- Yeah.

01:15:02.006 --> 01:15:05.005
Quite a lot has happened. You
and I had a fight recently.

01:15:05.005 --> 01:15:07.005
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easy.

01:15:07.005 --> 01:15:09.004
- That doesn't sound right.
- Well, it's true.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:14.004
It seems that that seductive Lord
of Thunder has stolen him away...

01:15:14.004 --> 01:15:17.004
Seductive God of Thunder.
We have to go.

01:15:20.004 --> 01:15:25.001
This is bad. This
is really, really bad.

01:15:26.003 --> 01:15:28.003
Thor.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
- I think I'm freaking out.
- No, don't freak out.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
- You're okay. Put these on.
- These are Tony's clothes. Is he here?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.008
No, he's not here. Listen, you stay
calm, okay? The sun's going down.

01:15:40.009 --> 01:15:42.009
The sun's going down.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:51.009
I'm upset.

01:15:53.008 --> 01:15:57.006
I'm very upset. Do you know
what I like about being upset?

01:15:57.006 --> 01:16:01.006
Blame. And now that's the mindset that
I'm in. And you know who I'm blaming?

01:16:01.006 --> 01:16:04.005
- Grandmaster, I ..
- Hey, don't interrupt me.

01:16:04.005 --> 01:16:08.004
Why are you handing
me the melt stick?

01:16:08.005 --> 01:16:12.003
He was interrupting. That's
not a capital violation.

01:16:12.003 --> 01:16:15.005
Where was I? My precious
champion has gone missing.

01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:18.002
And it's all because of
that Lord of Thunder.

01:16:18.002 --> 01:16:20.002
It's all because of
him, your brother.

01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:24.004
Whatever the story is. Adopted or
complicated. I'm sure there's a history.

01:16:24.004 --> 01:16:26.004
And your contender.

01:16:27.001 --> 01:16:31.001
My dear friend, if you were to give me 12
hours, I can bring them both back to you alive.

01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:33.002
I can do it in 2.

01:16:33.002 --> 01:16:36.000
- I can do it in one.
- Let's stop there.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.001
You know what, I woke up this morning
thinking about public execution.

01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:44.009
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

01:16:45.008 --> 01:16:48.009
So, you're on the clock.

01:16:49.009 --> 01:16:52.000
- What have you done?
- I don't answer to you, Lackey.

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:55.009
It's Loki, and you will
answer to the Grandmaster.

01:16:57.009 --> 01:17:00.008
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

01:17:00.008 --> 01:17:03.005
I don't help anyone.

01:17:09.004 --> 01:17:11.006
You are a Valkyrie.

01:17:15.004 --> 01:17:18.003
I thought the Valkyrie have
all died gruesome deaths.

01:17:18.003 --> 01:17:20.003
Choose your next
words wisely.

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:25.002
I'm terribly sorry, must've
been a very painful memory.

01:18:15.005 --> 01:18:21.006
The sun's going down,
the sun's really low...

01:18:21.006 --> 01:18:24.003
- The sun's going down...
- Would you stop saying that?

01:18:24.003 --> 01:18:25.003
I just need you
to stay calm.

01:18:25.003 --> 01:18:29.002
- Calm? I'm on an alien planet.
- It's just a planet, you've been to one before.

01:18:29.003 --> 01:18:33.002
- Yeah! One!
- Well, now you've been on two! That's a good thing.

01:18:33.002 --> 01:18:38.000
- A new experience.
- My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information...

01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:40.001
The whole thing is
totally different this time.

01:18:40.002 --> 01:18:47.000
I mean, in the past when I was Hulk, I had a hand on the wheel,
but this time he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk!

01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:49.000
You're back now and
that's all that matters.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.008
No, it's not what matters. What I'm trying to tell you is
that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may not come back.

01:18:54.008 --> 01:18:57.009
And we're stranded in a planet
that is designed to stress me out.

01:18:57.009 --> 01:19:01.007
We are not stranded, I'm gonna
figure out a way to get us home.

01:19:01.007 --> 01:19:03.008
- Thank you.
- Not your home, though. Asgard.

01:19:03.008 --> 01:19:05.006
- My home.
- What?

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:11.007
Listen, my people are in grave danger. You and I have to
fight this powerful being who happens to be my sister.

01:19:11.008 --> 01:19:15.005
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.

01:19:15.005 --> 01:19:16.005
- That's a family issue.
- She's an evil being.

01:19:17.007 --> 01:19:21.004
I don't care what she is. I'm not fighting
any more beings. I'm sick of it.

01:19:21.004 --> 01:19:26.005
I just told you. If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.

01:19:26.005 --> 01:19:29.004
- And you don't care!
- No, I'm putting together a team.

01:19:29.005 --> 01:19:30.005
Hulk is the fire.

01:19:30.005 --> 01:19:34.003
- Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!

01:19:34.004 --> 01:19:36.003
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

01:19:36.003 --> 01:19:41.002
No. I don't even like the Hulk.
He's like.... Smash, smash!

01:19:41.002 --> 01:19:43.003
I prefer you.

01:19:43.003 --> 01:19:45.001
Thanks.

01:19:45.001 --> 01:19:50.000
But honestly when it comes to fighting evil
beings, he is very powerful and useful.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.009
- Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
- Is he, though?

01:19:52.009 --> 01:19:55.000
Okay, how many PhD's
does Hulk have? Zero.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
How many PhD's does
Banner have? Seven.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.009
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone. But
we're in danger here, so let's get on it.

01:20:05.008 --> 01:20:07.008
- What are you doing with that?
- I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

01:20:07.009 --> 01:20:10.007
- I need a disguise.
- You are in disguise.

01:20:10.007 --> 01:20:12.006
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

01:20:12.006 --> 01:20:14.006
Yeah, Tony and the gypsy.

01:20:14.006 --> 01:20:16.007
No, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce Banner.

01:20:16.007 --> 01:20:18.005
Then why did you
dress me up like Tony?

01:20:18.006 --> 01:20:19.006
Because you were naked.

01:20:19.006 --> 01:20:21.005
Okay, I'll give you that.

01:20:21.005 --> 01:20:24.005
- What are you doing? Stop doing that.
- Sorry. Tony wears his pants super tight.

01:20:24.005 --> 01:20:26.005
Why are you
being so weird?

01:20:26.005 --> 01:20:30.004
I don't know, maybe the fact
that I was trapped for 2 years...

01:20:30.004 --> 01:20:32.005
inside of a monster
made me a little weird!

01:20:32.006 --> 01:20:35.004
Hey... it's okay.
Look...

01:20:35.004 --> 01:20:41.002
Calm down... come on. We'll go to Asgard, and you
don't worry about being the Hulk ever again.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.003
- All right?
- All right.

01:20:49.002 --> 01:20:52.001
Oh, this is bad...

01:20:55.002 --> 01:20:58.000
Banner!
Banner!

01:21:00.009 --> 01:21:02.001
Banner!

01:21:15.007 --> 01:21:18.008
- Banner!
- Thor!

01:21:29.005 --> 01:21:31.005
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:31.005 --> 01:21:34.004
- I was gonna do that.
- I did it first.

01:21:34.004 --> 01:21:36.005
Good. What are you doing here?

01:21:36.005 --> 01:21:38.004
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

01:21:38.004 --> 01:21:40.004
I got sidetracked.

01:21:40.004 --> 01:21:43.002
- What's with the...?
- This is my disguise.

01:21:43.002 --> 01:21:47.001
- I can see your face.
- Not when I do this, you can't.

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:51.003
Looks like you can help me.
Do you want to help us?

01:21:56.002 --> 01:22:00.002
What's are those things on her eyes? Are those
people that she's killed? So beautiful and strong...

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:02.002
- Who is this guy?
- A friend.

01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:04.002
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.009
I feel like I know you, too.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:14.008
Look, I spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.

01:22:14.008 --> 01:22:18.007
Sakaar seemed like the best place to
drink and forget and to die one day.

01:22:18.007 --> 01:22:21.007
I was thinking if you drink too much,
that's probably what's gonna kill you.

01:22:21.008 --> 01:22:23.008
- I don't plan to stop drinking.
- Oh.

01:22:23.008 --> 01:22:26.006
But I don't wanna forget. I
can't run away anymore.

01:22:26.006 --> 01:22:32.007
So if I'm gonna die, it may as well be driving
my sword thru the heart of that murderous hag.

01:22:32.007 --> 01:22:34.006
Good. Yeah.

01:22:34.006 --> 01:22:38.004
So I'm saying that I
wanna be on the team.

01:22:38.004 --> 01:22:42.004
- Has it got a name?
- Yeah, it's called the... Revengers.

01:22:42.005 --> 01:22:46.005
- Revengers?
- Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.

01:22:46.005 --> 01:22:51.004
- You're... do you want revenge?
- I'm.... undecided.

01:22:51.005 --> 01:22:56.003
Also, I've got a
peace offering.

01:22:58.002 --> 01:23:01.001
Surprise!

01:23:06.009 --> 01:23:09.001
Had to be sure.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Hello, Bruce.

01:23:14.001 --> 01:23:18.009
So, the last time I saw you, you were trying to
kill everybody. Where are you at these days?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.009
It varies from
moment to moment.

01:23:21.009 --> 01:23:27.006
- Is that a Dragon Fang? Oh, my God!
- It is.

01:23:27.006 --> 01:23:28.008
The famed sword
of the Valkyrie.

01:23:28.009 --> 01:23:32.006
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about
as far apart as a system, our best bet

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:35.005
is a wormhole just
outside the city limits.

01:23:35.005 --> 01:23:38.007
Refuel on Xandar and we can
be back in Asgard in, 18 months?

01:23:38.007 --> 01:23:42.005
Nope. We are going
through the big one.

01:23:42.005 --> 01:23:45.003
- The Devil's Anus?
- Anus?

01:23:45.003 --> 01:23:48.004
- Wait, whose anus?
- For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.

01:23:48.004 --> 01:23:52.003
That looks like a Clapton Neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen bridge.

01:23:52.004 --> 01:23:55.003
We need another ship. That
will tear mine to pieces.

01:23:55.003 --> 01:23:58.004
She's right. We need one that can withstand
the geode that stray from singularities.

01:23:58.004 --> 01:24:02.648
And has an offline power steering system
that can function without a computer.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.003
And we need one with cupholders
because we're gonna die, so... drinks!

01:24:06.003 --> 01:24:10.002
- Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
- I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:16.009
What do you say? Uncharted intergalactic travel
wormhole cosmic gateway? Talk about adventure.

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:19.000
- We need a ship.
- Two ships.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.009
- Have to look top of the line models.
- I don't mean to impose...

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.009
But the Grandmaster has
a great many ships.

01:24:26.009 --> 01:24:30.007
I may even have stolen the access
codes to his security system.

01:24:30.007 --> 01:24:32.008
And suddenly you're overcome
with the urge to do the right thing?

01:24:32.008 --> 01:24:35.007
Heavens, no. I've run out of
favor with the Grandmaster...

01:24:35.008 --> 01:24:41.006
In exchange for codes and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage. Thru the Anus.

01:24:41.006 --> 01:24:46.004
So you can get us access to the
garage without setting off the alarms?

01:24:46.004 --> 01:24:47.005
Yes, brother. I can.

01:24:47.006 --> 01:24:50.006
Okay, can I just...
A quick FYI?

01:24:50.006 --> 01:24:55.003
I was just talking to him and
he was ready to kill any of us.

01:24:55.003 --> 01:24:58.003
- He did try to kill me.
- Yes, me too. Many, many occasions.

01:24:58.003 --> 01:25:03.002
One time when we're children, he transformed into a snake,
and he knows I love snakes, so I went to admire it...

01:25:03.002 --> 01:25:09.001
And he transformed back to himself, and
he's like, "It's me!" And he stabbed me.

01:25:09.001 --> 01:25:11.001
We were 8 at the time.

01:25:11.001 --> 01:25:14.001
If we're boosting a ship, we're gonna need
to draw some guards away from the palace.

01:25:14.001 --> 01:25:15.009
Why not set the beast loose?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
- Shhh. Shut up.
- He said a beast?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.009
There's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

01:25:20.009 --> 01:25:22.009
- We're gonna start a revolution.
- Revolution?

01:25:22.009 --> 01:25:25.000
- I'll explain later.
- Who is this guy again?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I'll explain later.

01:25:27.008 --> 01:25:32.009
Is it some sort of protoplasm, all
the stuff coming out of you or eggs?

01:25:33.008 --> 01:25:35.007
It looks like eggs.

01:25:36.008 --> 01:25:39.006
Ooh!

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:46.007
- I'm looking for Korg.
- Who's asking?

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:50.006
I know you're asking. Is
anyone else asking or just you?

01:25:50.006 --> 01:25:53.006
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

01:25:56.004 --> 01:25:58.004
The revolution has begun!

01:25:58.004 --> 01:26:00.004
Revolution?
How did this happen?

01:26:00.004 --> 01:26:07.002
Don't know. But the arena's mainframe for the obedience disks are deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves.

01:26:07.003 --> 01:26:11.001
- Oh, I don't like that word.
- Mainframe?

01:26:11.002 --> 01:26:15.002
No, why would I not like
mainframe? No. The S word.

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:19.002
- Sorry. The prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.
- Okay. That's better.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Listen. We should talk.

01:26:30.001 --> 01:26:34.008
I disagree. Open communication
is never our family's forte.

01:26:34.008 --> 01:26:38.009
You have no idea. Been quite the
revelation since we last spoke.

01:26:38.009 --> 01:26:40.007
Hello.

01:26:40.007 --> 01:26:42.007
Hi.

01:26:48.007 --> 01:26:50.007
The Odin boys together.

01:26:50.007 --> 01:26:54.006
It's almost poetic that his
death have split us apart.

01:27:00.003 --> 01:27:02.003
We might as well
be strangers now.

01:27:02.004 --> 01:27:06.002
Two sons of the
crown, set adrift.

01:27:06.003 --> 01:27:08.003
Do not move!

01:27:08.003 --> 01:27:10.003
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

01:27:11.004 --> 01:27:12.004
Here's the thing...

01:27:12.004 --> 01:27:17.002
- I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

01:27:18.002 --> 01:27:21.001
- Did you just agree with me?
- This place is perfect for you.

01:27:21.001 --> 01:27:25.000
It's savage, chaotic, lawless.
You'll do great here.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.001
Do you truly think
so little of me?

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:34.000
Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought
we were gonna fight side by side forever, but...

01:27:34.001 --> 01:27:37.008
At the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

01:27:37.008 --> 01:27:44.007
Maybe there's still good in you, but let's be
honest. Our paths diverged a long time ago.

01:27:47.009 --> 01:27:52.007
We have. It's probably for the best if
we never see each other again.

01:27:52.007 --> 01:27:55.007
That's what you've
always wanted.

01:27:58.005 --> 01:28:00.004
Hey, let's do ''get help.''

01:28:00.004 --> 01:28:01.006
- What?
- ''Get help.''

01:28:01.006 --> 01:28:02.005
- No.
- Come on, you'll love it.

01:28:02.006 --> 01:28:04.006
- I hate it. It's humiliating.
- It's great. Works every time.

01:28:05.003 --> 01:28:06.004
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.

01:28:06.004 --> 01:28:10.004
- We're doing it.
- We are not doing ''get help.''

01:28:10.005 --> 01:28:13.003
Get help, please!
My brother is dying!

01:28:13.003 --> 01:28:16.002
Get help! Help him.

01:28:17.002 --> 01:28:22.003
- Classic. Not for me, it's not.
- Still hate it. Humiliating.

01:28:22.003 --> 01:28:26.002
- Now which one's the ship you told us to get?
- The commodore.

01:28:30.001 --> 01:28:34.000
Though I feel it wouldn't
make much of a difference.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.001
Loki...

01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:40.009
I know I betrayed you many times before,
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.009
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.008
- Never one for sentiment, were you?
- Easier to let it burn.

01:28:47.008 --> 01:28:49.009
I agree.

01:28:56.007 --> 01:28:59.005
Oh, it looks painful.

01:28:59.006 --> 01:29:02.005
Dear Brother, you're
becoming predictable.

01:29:02.005 --> 01:29:06.005
I trust you, you betray me, round
and round in circles we go.

01:29:06.005 --> 01:29:13.005
See, life is about growth, about change.
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

01:29:13.005 --> 01:29:18.004
I guess what I'm trying to say is that
you'll always be the God of Mischief...

01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:21.002
But you could be more.

01:29:22.004 --> 01:29:24.003
I'll just put this
over here for you.

01:29:24.004 --> 01:29:29.001
Anyway, I've got places
to be, so good luck.

01:29:33.002 --> 01:29:37.009
I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:53.007
Loyal Sakaarians. Lord of
Thunder has stolen my ship,

01:29:53.008 --> 01:29:58.007
and my favorite champion?
Sakaarians, take the skies!

01:29:58.007 --> 01:30:02.006
Bring him down. Do not let
him leave this planet.

01:30:14.005 --> 01:30:17.004
- Good shot.
- Thanks.

01:30:18.005 --> 01:30:21.004
- Opening doors.
- Okay.

01:30:26.002 --> 01:30:29.003
- I hope you're tougher than you look!
- Why?

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:45.000
- Shouldn't we shoot it back or something?
- Yes, we should.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.008
Where are the
guns on this ship?

01:30:46.009 --> 01:30:53.000
There aren't any. It's a () vessel.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.008
Did she just
say orgies?

01:30:55.008 --> 01:30:58.009
Don't touch anything.

01:31:18.004 --> 01:31:20.004
No!

01:31:22.004 --> 01:31:24.004
- No!
- No!

01:31:30.005 --> 01:31:34.003
- Get inside!
- In a minute!

01:31:44.001 --> 01:31:46.001
I should probably go to help.
Here, take the wheel!

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:49.009
- No, I can't fly one of these!
- You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

01:31:49.009 --> 01:31:54.000
None of them are for
fying alien spaceships!

01:32:28.003 --> 01:32:32.002
There's gotta be a gun on this
thing. That looks like a gun.

01:32:45.001 --> 01:32:47.001
Yeah!

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.009
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus.

01:33:11.009 --> 01:33:15.007
There she is. Our
ticket out of here.

01:33:15.007 --> 01:33:18.007
Hey, what's this?

01:33:21.007 --> 01:33:25.005
- Thank you.
- Hey man. We're about to jump on this ginormous spaceship.

01:33:25.005 --> 01:33:29.004
- Do you want to come?
- Well, you do seem like...

01:33:29.005 --> 01:33:33.003
- You're in desperate need of leadership.
- Why, thank you.

01:33:36.003 --> 01:33:39.002
Here we go!

01:33:44.002 --> 01:33:46.002
Shit!

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Asgardians! Some
misguided soul,

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.008
has stolen the Bifrost
sword. Tell us where it is,

01:34:11.008 --> 01:34:15.007
or there will be
consequences.

01:34:18.006 --> 01:34:20.007
Bad ones.

01:34:22.007 --> 01:34:25.007
So?

01:34:30.006 --> 01:34:33.005
You.

01:34:39.003 --> 01:34:41.004
Please!

01:35:07.008 --> 01:35:13.000
Well? Executioner?

01:35:16.007 --> 01:35:19.008
Wait...!

01:35:20.008 --> 01:35:23.007
I know where the sword is.

01:36:04.002 --> 01:36:07.001
I never thought
I'd be back here.

01:36:10.001 --> 01:36:11.009
I thought it'd
be a lot nicer.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Not that it's not nice.
It's, it's on fire.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.009
Here, up on the mountains.
Heat signatures.

01:36:17.009 --> 01:36:19.009
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.007
Drop me off at the palace.
I'll lure her away.

01:36:22.007 --> 01:36:24.009
- And get yourself killed?
- The people trapped there are all that matters.

01:36:24.009 --> 01:36:28.006
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need
you two to help get them off Asgard.

01:36:28.007 --> 01:36:32.008
- How are we supposed to do that?
- I have a man on the ground.

01:36:38.004 --> 01:36:40.005
Asgard...

01:36:42.004 --> 01:36:44.006
She's here.

01:36:55.003 --> 01:36:59.001
- Now, ship has a gun.
- I'll take it from here.

01:36:59.002 --> 01:37:02.003
I found this
in the armory.

01:37:05.002 --> 01:37:07.002
Good luck.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.001
Your Majesty.

01:37:11.001 --> 01:37:13.001
Don't die.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.009
You know what I mean.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Keep moving!

01:38:17.001 --> 01:38:20.000
Go to the Bifrost.

01:39:00.005 --> 01:39:02.004
Sister.

01:39:04.003 --> 01:39:06.002
You are still alive.

01:39:06.002 --> 01:39:08.001
I love what you've
done to the place.

01:39:08.002 --> 01:39:09.003
Redecorating, I see.

01:39:09.004 --> 01:39:14.118
It seems our father's solution to
every problem was to cover it up.

01:39:14.221 --> 01:39:16.222
Or to cast it out.

01:39:17.254 --> 01:39:21.262
He told you you were worthy,
he said the same thing to me.

01:39:21.951 --> 01:39:25.951
You see? You
never knew him.

01:39:26.285 --> 01:39:27.294
Not at his best.

01:39:29.278 --> 01:39:33.286
Odin and I drowned entire
civilizations in blood and tears.

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.539
Where do you think
all this gunk came from?

01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:41.135
And then, one day he decided
to become a benevolent king.

01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.301
Fostered peace
to protect life.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.440
To have you.

01:39:46.648 --> 01:39:52.646
I understand why you're angry, and as my sister
you technically have a claim to the throne...

01:39:53.019 --> 01:39:56.018
Believe me, I want someone
else to rule. But it can't be you.

01:39:57.432 --> 01:39:58.433
You're just...

01:39:59.274 --> 01:40:01.274
Worst.

01:40:02.035 --> 01:40:04.035
Okay. Get up.

01:40:04.336 --> 01:40:06.336
You are on my seat.

01:40:06.756 --> 01:40:11.755
Our father once told me, "a
wise king never seeks out war..."

01:40:11.867 --> 01:40:14.868
"But must always
be ready for it."

01:40:45.136 --> 01:40:47.134
Go back!

01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:54.419
Go!

01:41:28.074 --> 01:41:31.072
To be honest,
I expected more.

01:41:33.603 --> 01:41:36.603
Heimdall.

01:41:36.864 --> 01:41:38.865
The sword!

01:41:43.077 --> 01:41:47.077
Here's the difference between us. I'm
Odin's firstborn. The rightful heir.

01:41:47.253 --> 01:41:51.251
The savior of Asgard.
And you are nothing.

01:42:01.267 --> 01:42:04.268
So simple. Even a
blind man can see it!

01:42:07.505 --> 01:42:11.502
Now you remind me of dad.

01:42:19.778 --> 01:42:22.778
This stupid dog won't die!

01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:45.381
Everything's gonna be alright, Val.
I got this.

01:42:46.031 --> 01:42:48.039
You wanted to know who I am?

01:42:48.983 --> 01:42:50.983
What the hell are you talking about?

01:42:51.078 --> 01:42:53.078
You will see.

01:43:40.692 --> 01:43:42.699
You see? No one's
going anywhere.

01:43:42.856 --> 01:43:45.982
I'll get that sword, even if I have to
kill every single one of them to do it.

01:44:13.163 --> 01:44:15.163
Hey, man.

01:44:15.506 --> 01:44:18.958
I'm Korg, this is Miek. We're gonna jump
on that spaceship and get out of here.

01:44:19.045 --> 01:44:20.543
Want to come?

01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:34.509
Your savior is here!

01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:44.430
Did you miss me? Every one.
Board that ship now.

01:44:48.103 --> 01:44:51.242
- Welcome home. Saw you coming.
- Of course you did.

01:45:08.009 --> 01:45:11.007
It will get another chance.

01:45:11.007 --> 01:45:17.004
You see, I'm not a
queen or a monster.

01:45:18.006 --> 01:45:21.004
I'm the goddess of death.

01:45:21.004 --> 01:45:24.005
What were you the god of again?

01:45:34.005 --> 01:45:37.002
Even when you had two eyes.

01:45:37.003 --> 01:45:40.002
You see only half the picture.

01:45:40.003 --> 01:45:44.001
She is too strong. Without
my hammer, I can't.

01:45:44.003 --> 01:45:48.000
Are you Thor, the
god of hammers?

01:45:51.001 --> 01:45:55.008
That hammer was to help you
control your power. Focus it.

01:45:55.009 --> 01:45:57.009
It was never your
source of strength.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.008
It's too late, she has
already taken Asgard.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.007
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

01:46:05.007 --> 01:46:07.007
This could be Asgard.

01:46:07.008 --> 01:46:09.009
Asgard is where
our people stand.

01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:15.341
Even now, right now. Those
people need your help.

01:46:22.007 --> 01:46:25.006
But I'm not as strong as you.

01:46:27.006 --> 01:46:31.006
No. You're stronger.

01:46:40.003 --> 01:46:45.001
Tell me, brother. What
were you the god of again?

01:48:57.945 --> 01:48:59.944
- You okay?
- You're missing an eye.

01:49:00.001 --> 01:49:02.000
Is there anything else?

01:49:08.197 --> 01:49:13.188
- I think we should disband the Revengers.
- Hit her with a lightning blast.

01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:17.229
I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast
in the history of lightning. It did nothing.

01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:22.349
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

01:49:22.437 --> 01:49:28.434
It won't end there. The longer Hela's
on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.

01:49:28.602 --> 01:49:30.601
She'll hunt us down.

01:49:30.711 --> 01:49:33.711
- We need to stop her here and now.
- So what do we do?

01:49:34.005 --> 01:49:36.007
I'm not doing "get help."

01:49:47.449 --> 01:49:51.447
Asgard is not a place.
It's a people.

01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:58.667
Loki, this was never about stopping
Ragnarok. This was about causing it.

01:49:58.701 --> 01:50:01.699
Surtur's crown, in the vault.

01:50:01.724 --> 01:50:03.724
It's the only way.

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:07.898
Bold move, brother.
Even for you.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.444
- Shall we?
- After you.

01:50:38.641 --> 01:50:40.641
This is madness.

01:50:53.552 --> 01:50:56.989
Go! Go now!

01:51:55.313 --> 01:51:57.314
For Asgard!

01:52:36.008 --> 01:52:41.006
With the Eternal
Flame, you are reborn.

01:52:51.546 --> 01:52:54.545
Hela! Enough!

01:52:56.347 --> 01:53:03.344
- You want Asgard? It's yours!
- Whatever game you're playing, it won't work.

01:53:03.472 --> 01:53:05.471
You can't defeat me.

01:53:05.496 --> 01:53:07.496
Oh, I know.

01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:10.669
But he can.

01:53:23.001 --> 01:53:30.000
Asgard! I am your reckoning!

01:53:37.245 --> 01:53:41.245
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.

01:53:43.642 --> 01:53:46.903
- We're fulfilling the prophecy.
- I hate this prophecy.

01:53:47.047 --> 01:53:56.046
So do I but we have no choice. Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela so that our people may live.

01:53:57.799 --> 01:53:59.799
No!

01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:04.349
Hulk, stop, you moron!

01:54:11.885 --> 01:54:17.882
Hulk, stop! Just for once
in your life, don't smash.

01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:19.929
Big monster!

01:54:20.152 --> 01:54:23.556
- Let's go!
- Fine!

01:54:47.595 --> 01:54:51.593
I am your doom!

01:55:12.614 --> 01:55:18.613
The damage looks bad, but as long as the foundations
are still strong, we can rebuild this place.

01:55:18.767 --> 01:55:24.764
It will become a haven for all
peoples and aliens of the universe.

01:55:30.002 --> 01:55:34.000
No. Those foundations are gone.
Sorry.

01:55:47.452 --> 01:55:50.452
Asgard's gone.

01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:52.950
You saved us from extinction.

01:55:53.006 --> 01:55:56.007
Asgard is not a place.

01:55:56.372 --> 01:55:58.463
It's a people.

01:56:27.001 --> 01:56:29.001
That suits you.

01:56:31.002 --> 01:56:34.000
You know, maybe you're not
so bad after all, brother.

01:56:34.002 --> 01:56:36.000
Maybe not.

01:56:36.002 --> 01:56:38.000
Thank you.

01:56:38.002 --> 01:56:41.001
If you're here, I might
even give you a home.

01:56:44.334 --> 01:56:46.334
I'm here.

01:57:08.754 --> 01:57:11.190
Your throne.

01:57:25.438 --> 01:57:29.439
Thor. King of Asgard.

01:57:38.303 --> 01:57:42.302
- Where to?
- I'm not sure.

01:57:42.793 --> 01:57:45.491
Any suggestions?

01:57:46.453 --> 01:57:50.445
- Miek, where are you from?
- Oh, Miek's dead.

01:57:50.770 --> 01:57:57.761
Yeah, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge. I
felt so guilty, I've been carrying him around all day.

01:57:58.975 --> 01:58:03.103
Oh, Miek, you're alive! He's alive, guys.
What was the question again, bruv?

01:58:03.614 --> 01:58:06.612
Earth, it is.
