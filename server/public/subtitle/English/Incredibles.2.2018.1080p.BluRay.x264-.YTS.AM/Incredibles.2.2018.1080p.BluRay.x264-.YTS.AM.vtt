INCREDIBLES 2

00:00:52.808 --> 00:00:55.301
File 82-712.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.510
Agent Rick Dicker
interrogating.

00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:59.292
State your name, please.

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:03.579
Uh, Tony.

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:05.431
Tony Rydinger.

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:09.546
Tell me about
the incident.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.316
Well, there's this girl,

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:12.890
um, in my class.

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:14.467
I saw her at the track meet.

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:17.281
You're, uh, Violet, right?
That's me.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:19.374
I sort of knew her,
but she'd changed.

00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:21.561
Relaxed.
She was more sure of herself.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.774
Cool, cute.

00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:24.209
I asked her out
to a movie.

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:25.266
So, Friday?

00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:26.352
Friday.
Friday.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.166
And I went to watch
the track meet.

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:32.229
Not long after, this
thing happened in the parking lot.

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.706
Behold! The Underminer!

00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:51.359
I am always beneath you,

00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:53.766
but nothing is beneath me!

00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:55.420
As if things aren't weird
enough,

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:57.305
I look over and I see these
boots.

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:58.796
You two, stay here.
Wait.

00:01:58.883 --> 00:01:59.983
Should we be doing this?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.025
It is still illegal.

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:02.984
They looked like superheroes.

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:04.688
We're gonna lose him.
Oh, all right.

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:06.077
One of you patrol
the perimeter,

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:07.391
keep the crowds
back and safe.

00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:08.538
The other,
watch after Jack-Jack.

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:09.626
But I thought
we were gonna

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:10.932
go with
You heard your mother.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.495
Trampoline me.

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:18.539
I call perimeter!

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:19.686
You're not going anywhere,

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.354
you little
maggoty creep!

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:23.225
I see my chance
to get out of there.

00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:24.756
But there's something

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.000
familiar about
one of the kids' voices.

00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:28.134
The girl, she's upset

00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:30.003
and she throws down
her mask

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.273
and it's her!

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.164
Oh. Tony!

00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:34.219
Hi.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.188
Uh, this isn't
what you think it is.

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:37.786
It was just getting
too freaky.

00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:39.791
I couldn't handle it
and ran off.

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.483
I feel kinda bad about it.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.266
Maybe I should've said
"hi" or something?

00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:46.399
It's not her fault
superheroes are illegal.

00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:48.249
And it's not like
I don't like strong girls.

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:50.766
I'm pretty secure
manhood wise.

00:02:50.853 --> 00:02:51.844
What is that?

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.891
Have you told anyone else about this?

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:55.514
Your parents?
No, they'd only think

00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:56.788
I was hiding something.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:58.898
You know what I mean?
Sure, kid.

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:00.562
I like this girl,
Mr. Dicker.

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.662
I'm supposed to go out with her
Friday night.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.713
Now, things are just gonna
be weird.

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.814
I wish I could forget
I ever saw her in that suit.

00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:10.377
You will, kid.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.684
You will.

00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:22.679
<font color=#FF00FF>*INCREDIBLES 2*</font>

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.407
Come on!

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:48.836
Consider yourself
undermined!

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:03.565
Ooh.

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:13.299
Underminer!
Oh!

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.287
We meet again Huh?

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:20.356
Oh, great!

00:04:20.482 --> 00:04:22.841
Now,
he's on the agenda.

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:39.072
Incredible!

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.408
Meet Jack Hammer!

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.466
Buh-bye!

00:05:07.848 --> 00:05:10.255
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.411
Everybody, stay back!
Okay? Stay back!

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:23.138
You're not sticking me
with babysitting!

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:28.768
I can't steer it or stop it.

00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:30.753
And the Underminer's escaped!

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.278
We'll have to stop it
Bob! The monorail!

00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:41.943
Frozone!
Yeah!

00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:47.643
We have to stop
this thing

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.035
before it gets
to the overpass!

00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:51.294
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings!

00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.638
Hey, lady!

00:06:04.652 --> 00:06:06.399
Thank you so much,
young man!

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:13.905
What?

00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:15.449
Violet!

00:06:18.382 --> 00:06:21.083
Oh, oh. Ahh!

00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:31.557
Stop!

00:06:31.644 --> 00:06:33.966
Everybody, stop!

00:06:59.551 --> 00:07:00.855
Ah, hah!

00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:05.286
Heads up, Dad!
Dash!

00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:09.713
Violet!
Who's watching Jack-Jack?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.071
Dash is watching him!
Violet,

00:07:11.158 --> 00:07:13.793
here, you take him!

00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:24.165
It's headed for City Hall!

00:07:24.252 --> 00:07:27.192
Mom needs help!

00:07:31.602 --> 00:07:34.183
They're out in public again!
This is our chance!

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.645
Follow them,
follow Frozone!

00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.582
Bob!
Help me with the boiler!

00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:10.980
That should do it!

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:13.276
What are you kids doing?
Get out of here!

00:08:13.363 --> 00:08:14.674
This thing's gonna blow!

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:16.545
There's no time!

00:08:28.222 --> 00:08:30.044
We did it!

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:31.497
Freeze, Supers!

00:08:31.584 --> 00:08:33.928
Oh, what did we do?

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:40.694
Excuse me,
Mr. Zone?

00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:45.498
Sorry,
but I'm not really supposed to be here.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.405
Which seems wrong

00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:48.620
doesn't it?

00:08:48.707 --> 00:08:52.334
Perhaps you'd be interested in
changing that law?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.637
Superheroes including Frozone,

00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:57.581
Mr. Incredible,
and Elasti Girl

00:08:57.668 --> 00:08:59.895
caused further damage
to the city.

00:08:59.982 --> 00:09:01.948
The Underminer
remains at large.

00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:03.777
We didn't start
this fight.

00:09:03.864 --> 00:09:05.049
Well, you didn't
finish it either!

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.467
Did you stop the Underminer
from inflicting more damage?

00:09:07.554 --> 00:09:08.855
No.
Did you stop him

00:09:08.942 --> 00:09:10.127
from robbing the banks?

00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:11.924
No.
Did you catch him?

00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:14.060
No.
The banks were insured.

00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:15.668
We have infrastructure
in place

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:16.643
to deal
with these matters.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.559
If you had simply
done nothing

00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:19.879
everything would now be

00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:21.424
proceeding
in an orderly fashion.

00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.815
You'd have preferred
we do nothing?

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:25.678
Without a doubt.

00:09:29.544 --> 00:09:31.031
You weren't much help.

00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:33.196
Do you want
out of the hole?

00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:36.168
First you gotta
put down the shovel.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.154
Well, that went poorly.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.035
Dad, this is probably

00:09:44.122 --> 00:09:47.020
not the best time
to tell you about this

00:09:47.098 --> 00:09:51.027
but something else
happened today with a kid

00:09:51.172 --> 00:09:53.202
and my mask.

00:10:05.936 --> 00:10:07.726
Oh, hey, Rick.

00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:10.775
Violet thinks a friend of hers,
a kid named Tony

00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:12.664
might have seen her
in the outfit,

00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:13.924
without her mask.

00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:15.625
Talkative type?
Don't know.

00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:17.305
Last name is Rydinger.

00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:19.473
Tony Rydinger.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.035
I'll check it out.

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:22.720
Bob, Helen

00:10:22.807 --> 00:10:24.762
a word
if you don't mind.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.314
Uh, the program's been
shut down.

00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:29.573
What?

00:10:29.738 --> 00:10:32.314
Politicians don't
understand people

00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:34.820
who do good simply
because it's right.

00:10:34.964 --> 00:10:36.572
It makes 'em nervous.

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:39.238
They've been gunning for Supers
for years.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.723
Today was all they needed.

00:10:41.862 --> 00:10:43.315
Anyway

00:10:43.544 --> 00:10:44.862
I'm done.

00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:47.063
I'm afraid two more
weeks in the motel

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.715
is the best
I can do for ya.

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:49.986
It ain't much.

00:10:50.073 --> 00:10:51.146
You've done plenty, Rick.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:52.550
We won't forget.

00:10:52.637 --> 00:10:54.939
Well, it has been
a great honor

00:10:55.026 --> 00:10:56.461
working with
you good people.

00:10:56.548 --> 00:10:58.969
Thanks for everything,
and good luck.

00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:01.285
Yeah.
You, too.

00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:17.535
Did you wash your hands?

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:21.460
With soap?

00:11:22.657 --> 00:11:24.613
Did you dry them?

00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:31.619
What?
Is this all vegetables?

00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:33.353
Who ordered all vegetables?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.524
I did. They're good
and you're going to have some.

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:39.103
Are we going
to talk about it?

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.556
What?
The elephant in the room.

00:11:41.643 --> 00:11:43.858
What elephant?
I guess not then.

00:11:43.945 --> 00:11:45.266
You're referring
to today.

00:11:45.353 --> 00:11:47.126
Yeah, what's the deal
with today?

00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:48.497
We all made mistakes.

00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:49.595
For example,

00:11:49.682 --> 00:11:51.457
you kids were supposed
to watch Jack-Jack.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.745
Babysitting,
while you guys did the important stuff.

00:11:54.832 --> 00:11:55.927
We talked about this.

00:11:56.014 --> 00:11:57.512
You're not old enough
to decide about these things.

00:11:57.599 --> 00:11:59.481
We are old enough
to help out.

00:11:59.568 --> 00:12:00.381
Yeah!

00:12:00.468 --> 00:12:01.951
Isn't that
what you tell us, Dad?

00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:03.865
Yeah, well,
"help out" can

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:05.287
mean many different things.

00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:06.473
But we're supposed to help,

00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:08.802
if there's trouble. Aren't you glad
Well, yeah, but

00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:10.224
we helped today?
Yeah, I know but

00:12:10.302 --> 00:12:11.403
You said that you were
proud of us.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.162
Well, yeah,
I was. Am!

00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:14.676
We wanna fight
bad guys!

00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:17.555
No, you don't!

00:12:17.788 --> 00:12:19.848
You said things
were different now.

00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:22.172
And they were,
on the island.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:23.926
But I didn't mean
that from now on

00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:26.817
So now, we've gotta go back
to never using our powers.

00:12:26.904 --> 00:12:28.154
It defines who I am.

00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:29.660
We're not saying
you have

00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:32.060
What?
Someone on TV said it.

00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:33.306
Can we just eat?

00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:35.531
The dinner, while it's hot?

00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:37.743
Did we do
something wrong?

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.172
Yes.
No.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.514
We didn't do
anything wrong.

00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:43.818
Superheroes are illegal.

00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:45.794
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:47.341
The law should be fair.

00:12:47.428 --> 00:12:48.691
What are we teaching our kids?

00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:50.000
To respect the law!

00:12:50.087 --> 00:12:51.645
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

00:12:51.732 --> 00:12:54.551
If laws are unjust,
there are laws to change them!

00:12:54.638 --> 00:12:55.902
Otherwise, it's chaos!

00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:58.281
Which is exactly
what we have!

00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:06.000
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

00:13:06.078 --> 00:13:07.094
What was?

00:13:07.172 --> 00:13:09.515
Fighting crime
as a family.

00:13:09.602 --> 00:13:12.753
It was cool.

00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:16.031
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:18.097
We have to adapt.

00:13:18.206 --> 00:13:19.970
Are things bad?

00:13:20.057 --> 00:13:21.620
Things are fine.

00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:24.148
May I be excused?

00:13:27.969 --> 00:13:30.838
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

00:13:30.925 --> 00:13:33.773
Uh
Not much longer, honey.

00:13:41.272 --> 00:13:42.384
What are we gonna do?

00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:43.976
I don't know.

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:47.182
Maybe Dicker will find something?
Dicker is done, Bob.

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:48.680
Any thought we had about being

00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:50.432
Supers again is fantasy.

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.180
One of us
has gotta get a job.

00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:53.449
One of us?

00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:55.705
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

00:13:55.792 --> 00:13:57.343
Hated every minute of it.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:58.971
I know
it was hard on you.

00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:00.979
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:03.548
and you take care of the kids
No, I'm doing this.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.504
I need to do this.

00:14:06.027 --> 00:14:07.934
You know where my suit
and ties are?

00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:09.190
Burned up when

00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:11.024
The jet destroyed our house.
The jet destroyed our house.

00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:12.661
Yeah.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.408
We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

00:14:15.495 --> 00:14:16.525
It's just us.

00:14:16.612 --> 00:14:18.426
We can't wait for

00:14:26.894 --> 00:14:28.955
No lifeguard on duty!

00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:30.502
Swim at your own risk.

00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:32.180
Oh, where'd you go today?

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:34.330
I noticed
you missed all the fun.

00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:37.134
Don't be mad because
I know when to leave a party.

00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:38.790
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:41.311
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:43.012
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.575
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:47.301
I heard
the program shut down.

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.446
How much longer
are you in this motel?

00:14:49.533 --> 00:14:50.566
Two weeks.

00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:52.418
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:54.854
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:56.525
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

00:14:56.612 --> 00:14:58.114
Well, door's always open.

00:14:58.433 --> 00:15:00.618
You know,
the news isn't all bad.

00:15:00.705 --> 00:15:03.268
While you guys
were being detained

00:15:03.355 --> 00:15:06.963
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.243
Winston Deavor.
Wants to talk

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.576
with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:13.649
I checked him out.

00:15:13.736 --> 00:15:14.745
He's legit.

00:15:14.832 --> 00:15:16.720
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

00:15:16.807 --> 00:15:18.846
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:21.118
We just came from
the police station, Lucius.

00:15:21.205 --> 00:15:24.153
When?
Tonight. I'm going there now.

00:15:24.742 --> 00:15:26.807
You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:28.066
He wants
all three of us.

00:15:28.153 --> 00:15:31.729
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:34.605
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

00:15:34.692 --> 00:15:36.874
Go in our Supersuits?

00:15:36.961 --> 00:15:38.089
Yeah.

00:15:38.403 --> 00:15:40.945
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

00:15:41.032 --> 00:15:43.621
Got a feeling
he's nostalgic.

00:15:47.398 --> 00:15:49.013
Where are you going?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.775
The fresh air
is especially good tonight.

00:15:51.862 --> 00:15:53.058
If Jack-Jack
wakes up

00:15:53.145 --> 00:15:55.067
I know the drill.

00:16:04.157 --> 00:16:06.011
Your security badges.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.781
Please, this way.

00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:09.502
Hey, listen,
you're my biggest fan.

00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:10.610
Good to see you.

00:16:10.697 --> 00:16:14.184
I'm your biggest fan.
Shoot!

00:16:36.972 --> 00:16:40.549
I love superheroes!

00:16:40.636 --> 00:16:42.586
The powers, the costumes

00:16:42.673 --> 00:16:44.156
the mythic struggles.

00:16:44.243 --> 00:16:46.344
Winston Deavor.
You can call me Win.

00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:47.932
Genuine pleasure
to meet you.

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:49.329
Frozone!
It's good to see you.

00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:50.982
Elasti Girl.
Nice to meet you.

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:53.066
Mr. Incredible!
Hello.

00:16:53.153 --> 00:16:55.916
Mr. Incredible,
Incredible

00:16:56.003 --> 00:16:57.408
Incredible
Incredible

00:16:57.495 --> 00:16:58.985
Catching the bad guys
Catching the bad guys

00:16:59.072 --> 00:17:00.743
Pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow

00:17:01.698 --> 00:17:03.995
Who's the cat
Who's always chill

00:17:04.082 --> 00:17:07.665
When survival odds
are close to nil

00:17:07.752 --> 00:17:10.918
Frozone
Frozone

00:17:11.005 --> 00:17:13.138
Frozone
Frozone

00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:14.739
Yeah!

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:17.502
Can't tell you what a thrill this is.
And this

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.517
Oh, hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.824
is my tardy sister,

00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:23.932
Evelyn.
And I'm

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:27.018
I'm scolding myself
so you don't have to, Winston!

00:17:27.105 --> 00:17:28.324
Spectacular.

00:17:28.411 --> 00:17:30.514
My father was so proud

00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:33.260
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

00:17:33.347 --> 00:17:35.961
He used to call you
the last line of defense.

00:17:36.048 --> 00:17:38.002
He was
your top supporter.

00:17:38.185 --> 00:17:40.691
He donated
to superhero causes.

00:17:40.778 --> 00:17:41.791
He raised money
for the

00:17:41.878 --> 00:17:43.712
Dynaguy statue
in Avery Park.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.736
He got to know
many Supers personally.

00:17:45.823 --> 00:17:47.245
Even installed a phone

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:50.590
with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic

00:17:50.677 --> 00:17:52.160
in case of emergencies.

00:17:52.247 --> 00:17:54.745
He loved that,
showed it off to everyone.

00:17:54.832 --> 00:17:56.074
He was heartbroken

00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:57.715
when you were all forced
to go underground.

00:17:57.802 --> 00:17:59.032
Father believed
the world

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:01.381
would become more dangerous
without you.

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.679
He didn't know
how right he was.

00:18:05.373 --> 00:18:06.935
There was a break in.

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:11.155
My father called Gazerbeam.

00:18:11.294 --> 00:18:12.683
The direct line.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.448
No answer.

00:18:14.535 --> 00:18:17.512
He called Fironic, no answer.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:20.559
Superheroes had just been
made illegal

00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:22.696
The robbers discovered him
on the phone

00:18:22.783 --> 00:18:24.902
and shot him.

00:18:25.846 --> 00:18:27.557
So

00:18:28.221 --> 00:18:29.453
It must've been hard.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.988
Especially for Mother.

00:18:31.112 --> 00:18:34.314
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

00:18:34.401 --> 00:18:37.259
If superheroes had not been
forced underground

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:38.359
it never would've happened.

00:18:38.446 --> 00:18:40.717
Or Dad could've taken
Mom to the safe room

00:18:40.804 --> 00:18:41.953
as soon as he knew
there was

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.436
trouble.
I disagree strongly!

00:18:43.523 --> 00:18:46.199
But we're not going
into it right now.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.831
The point is

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:49.462
nobody expected us

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:52.330
to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:55.800
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator

00:18:55.887 --> 00:18:58.376
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

00:18:58.463 --> 00:18:59.947
into what it is today.

00:19:00.034 --> 00:19:02.828
A world class
telecommunications company.

00:19:02.915 --> 00:19:04.025
Bigger than ever.

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:05.570
Perfectly positioned
to make

00:19:05.657 --> 00:19:07.237
some wrong things right.

00:19:07.324 --> 00:19:08.994
Hence, this meeting.

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:10.566
Let me
ask you something.

00:19:10.853 --> 00:19:12.353
What is the main reason

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.281
you were all
forced underground?

00:19:14.368 --> 00:19:16.447
Ignorance.
Perception.

00:19:16.534 --> 00:19:18.796
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

00:19:18.883 --> 00:19:20.124
Difficult situation.

00:19:20.211 --> 00:19:22.548
You were faced
with a lot of hard decisions.

00:19:22.635 --> 00:19:23.801
Oh, tell me about it.

00:19:23.888 --> 00:19:25.036
I can't.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.597
Because I didn't see it

00:19:27.684 --> 00:19:29.222
neither did anyone else.

00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:31.853
So, when you fight bad
guys like today

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.642
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

00:19:34.729 --> 00:19:37.066
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:39.743
They see destruction
and they see you.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.252
So, if we wanna change

00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:43.940
people's perceptions
about superheroes

00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:45.036
we need you

00:19:45.123 --> 00:19:47.739
to share your perceptions
with the world.

00:19:47.826 --> 00:19:50.335
How do we do that?
With cameras.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.895
We need you to share
your perceptions with the world.

00:19:53.982 --> 00:19:55.066
How do we do that?

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:57.268
We embed tiny cameras, like those,

00:19:57.355 --> 00:19:58.597
into your Supersuits.

00:19:58.684 --> 00:19:59.903
Wow, so small.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.406
And the picture
is outstanding.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:03.067
Thanks!
Designed 'em myself.

00:20:03.154 --> 00:20:04.775
We've got resources, lobbyists,

00:20:04.862 --> 00:20:06.261
worldwide connections

00:20:06.348 --> 00:20:08.567
and very important,
insurance.

00:20:08.654 --> 00:20:09.801
Insurance is key.

00:20:09.888 --> 00:20:12.301
All we need now
are the superest superheroes.

00:20:12.388 --> 00:20:14.830
It needs you three.
Come on!

00:20:14.917 --> 00:20:17.958
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

00:20:18.045 --> 00:20:19.544
This sounds great!

00:20:19.631 --> 00:20:21.597
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

00:20:21.684 --> 00:20:23.754
That enthusiasm is golden.

00:20:23.841 --> 00:20:26.222
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.866
Well, Elasti Girl
is our best play.

00:20:29.794 --> 00:20:32.444
Better than me?

00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:34.651
I mean, she's good.

00:20:34.738 --> 00:20:37.390
Really, a credit to her

00:20:37.482 --> 00:20:39.745
You know.
You know.

00:20:39.832 --> 00:20:41.015
With great respect

00:20:41.102 --> 00:20:42.213
let's not test the whole

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.395
"insurance will pay for everything"
idea

00:20:44.482 --> 00:20:46.890
on the first go 'round, okay?

00:20:47.021 --> 00:20:50.083
Wait a minute.
You're saying what? I'm messy?

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.364
Well, Evelyn did
a cost benefit analysis

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.425
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

00:20:54.512 --> 00:20:55.840
before going underground.

00:20:55.927 --> 00:20:58.155
And Elasti Girl's numbers
are self explanatory.

00:20:58.302 --> 00:21:00.356
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

00:21:00.443 --> 00:21:03.001
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:04.683
Of course!
We're gonna solve

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.837
all kinds
of problems together.

00:21:06.924 --> 00:21:11.476
After the perfect launch
with Elasti Girl!

00:21:12.201 --> 00:21:14.400
So, what do you say?

00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:17.241
What do I say?

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.837
I don't know.

00:21:19.924 --> 00:21:21.848
What do you mean,
you don't know?

00:21:21.935 --> 00:21:24.159
A few hours ago,
you were saying it was over

00:21:24.246 --> 00:21:26.333
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.393
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.739
and you don't know?

00:21:29.826 --> 00:21:31.433
It's not that simple, Bob.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.316
I wanna protect the kids!

00:21:33.403 --> 00:21:34.691
So do I.

00:21:34.778 --> 00:21:36.434
From jail, Bob!

00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:37.705
And how do you do that?

00:21:37.801 --> 00:21:39.824
By turning down a chance
to change the law

00:21:39.902 --> 00:21:41.630
that forces them to hide
what they are?

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.108
They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.

00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:46.653
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.080
whether they decide
to use those powers or not.

00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:50.331
This will benefit them.

00:21:50.418 --> 00:21:52.575
What? It's not a good time
to be away.

00:21:52.662 --> 00:21:54.356
Dash is having trouble
with homework

00:21:54.443 --> 00:21:55.776
Vi is worried
about her first date

00:21:55.863 --> 00:21:57.309
with that boy she likes,
Tony

00:21:57.394 --> 00:21:58.432
and Jack-Jack

00:21:58.512 --> 00:22:00.749
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

00:22:01.105 --> 00:22:02.691
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

00:22:02.778 --> 00:22:05.362
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.083
I'm just not sure
I can leave.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.466
Of course
you can leave.

00:22:08.553 --> 00:22:10.546
You've got to.
So that I

00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:12.301
we can be Supers again,

00:22:12.388 --> 00:22:14.395
so our kids can have
that choice.

00:22:14.482 --> 00:22:16.374
So you can have that choice.

00:22:16.461 --> 00:22:17.825
All right, yes!

00:22:17.912 --> 00:22:19.921
So I can have
that choice.

00:22:20.224 --> 00:22:22.598
And I would do a great job!

00:22:22.685 --> 00:22:26.741
Regardless of what Deavor's
pie charts say or whatever

00:22:27.137 --> 00:22:28.819
But they want you.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:32.165
And you'll do a great

00:22:32.836 --> 00:22:34.172
job

00:22:34.763 --> 00:22:36.037
too.

00:22:37.342 --> 00:22:40.398
Well, that was excruciating to watch.

00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:42.593
I can't lie to you.

00:22:42.693 --> 00:22:44.137
It's nice to be wanted.

00:22:44.224 --> 00:22:45.872
Flattering, you know,
but

00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:46.971
But what's the choice?

00:22:47.058 --> 00:22:48.157
One, do this right,

00:22:48.244 --> 00:22:49.784
get well paid,
we're out of the motel

00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:51.378
and things get better
for all Supers,

00:22:51.465 --> 00:22:52.851
including our kids.

00:22:52.941 --> 00:22:54.238
Or two

00:22:54.545 --> 00:22:57.093
I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.669
You know
it's crazy, right?

00:22:59.756 --> 00:23:01.450
To help my family,
I gotta leave it.

00:23:01.537 --> 00:23:03.690
To fix the law, I gotta break it.
You'll be great.

00:23:03.777 --> 00:23:04.948
I know I will.

00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:06.399
But what about you?
We have kids.

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:08.126
I'll watch the kids,
no problem.

00:23:08.213 --> 00:23:09.729
Easy.
Easy, huh?

00:23:09.816 --> 00:23:11.153
You're adorable.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.349
Well, if there is
a problem,

00:23:12.427 --> 00:23:13.946
I'll drop this thing
and come right back.

00:23:14.033 --> 00:23:15.087
You won't need to.

00:23:15.174 --> 00:23:17.880
I got it,
you go do this thing.

00:23:18.028 --> 00:23:19.700
Do it so

00:23:20.293 --> 00:23:22.563
I can do it better.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.831
Deavor here.

00:23:24.918 --> 00:23:26.497
This is Elasti Girl.

00:23:26.612 --> 00:23:27.660
I'm in.

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:33.151
Mr. Deavor,
it's wonderful

00:23:33.238 --> 00:23:34.807
but it's too generous.

00:23:34.894 --> 00:23:36.654
Nonsense!
That's the least we can do.

00:23:36.741 --> 00:23:38.166
We're partners now!

00:23:38.253 --> 00:23:40.165
Can't have my partners
living in a motel.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.565
But whose house?
Is it a house?

00:23:42.652 --> 00:23:44.188
It's my house.
I have several.

00:23:44.275 --> 00:23:47.009
I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.

00:23:47.096 --> 00:23:48.566
I don't know
what to say.

00:23:48.653 --> 00:23:50.802
How about "thanks"?

00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:53.397
This is our new house?

00:23:53.484 --> 00:23:56.735
Okay, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

00:23:56.822 --> 00:23:58.744
This is homey.

00:23:58.831 --> 00:23:59.946
Look at this place.

00:24:00.033 --> 00:24:02.321
Deavor bought it from
an eccentric billionaire

00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:04.751
who liked to come and go
without being seen

00:24:04.838 --> 00:24:07.178
so the house has
multiple hidden exits.

00:24:07.265 --> 00:24:09.056
Good thing
we won't stand out.

00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:12.228
Wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention.

00:24:12.315 --> 00:24:14.228
It's got a big yard!

00:24:14.315 --> 00:24:16.361
Isn't this a bit much?

00:24:16.448 --> 00:24:18.151
Near a forest!

00:24:18.238 --> 00:24:20.181
Would you rather be
at the motel?

00:24:20.268 --> 00:24:22.462
And a pool!

00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:24.877
What exactly
is Mom's new job?

00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:27.138
The important thing is
we're out of the motel.

00:24:27.225 --> 00:24:29.747
I like Mom's new job!

00:24:30.555 --> 00:24:32.585
Oh, ho, ho!

00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:39.941
Whoa.

00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:43.955
Well, check out
the water features.

00:24:46.104 --> 00:24:47.533
Oh!
Wow.

00:24:49.085 --> 00:24:51.128
Wicked cool!

00:24:56.974 --> 00:24:58.302
Hey! Dash! Stop it!

00:24:58.389 --> 00:25:00.442
Not the couch! Stop it!
No! Dash!

00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:02.076
Stop!

00:25:02.163 --> 00:25:03.434
Don't touch the buttons!
The couch!

00:25:03.521 --> 00:25:04.342
Dash!
No!

00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:06.212
No, no!

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.176
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.995
This isn't me.

00:25:12.632 --> 00:25:15.725
I'm not all dark
and angsty.

00:25:15.812 --> 00:25:17.102
I'm Elasti Girl.

00:25:17.189 --> 00:25:18.850
I'm, you know,
flexible.

00:25:18.937 --> 00:25:20.391
I mean, look at this.
E designed this?

00:25:20.478 --> 00:25:23.530
No, some guy named
Alexander Galbaki.

00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:25.662
Glad it's you and not me,

00:25:25.749 --> 00:25:27.954
'cause you're gonna
hear from her.

00:25:28.212 --> 00:25:29.634
This note came with it.

00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:30.820
What?

00:25:37.555 --> 00:25:39.850
A new Elasticycle.

00:25:39.937 --> 00:25:42.459
Elasticycle?
I didn't know you had a bike.

00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:43.709
Hey, I had a mohawk.

00:25:43.796 --> 00:25:45.333
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.225
Yeah, but
A mohawk?

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:49.399
Ah, you didn't miss anything.

00:25:52.036 --> 00:25:54.592
Oh, yeah!
This one's electric.

00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:57.306
What's that mean?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:26:00.473 --> 00:26:03.238
Means it's torque-y.
I'll get the hang of it.

00:26:03.325 --> 00:26:04.395
You will be great.

00:26:04.482 --> 00:26:06.416
I will be great.
And you will, too.

00:26:06.503 --> 00:26:08.009
We will both be great.

00:26:08.096 --> 00:26:09.448
Bye, sweetie.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.134
Wait a minute!

00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:34.895
Is that Elasti Girl?
I think that's Elasti Girl.

00:26:34.982 --> 00:26:37.380
Hey! Elasti Girl!

00:26:43.254 --> 00:26:45.880
Marry me, Elasti Girl!

00:26:47.965 --> 00:26:49.980
Here comes Elasti Girl

00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:51.516
No theme songs
Stretching her

00:26:51.603 --> 00:26:54.302
or I'll turn this bus
right around!

00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:58.438
Look at that.

00:26:58.525 --> 00:26:59.590
New Urbem.

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:01.792
You wanna make a big
crime fighting statement

00:27:01.879 --> 00:27:03.690
you go where
the crime is big.

00:27:03.777 --> 00:27:05.915
Strange thing to be
excited about, Winston.

00:27:06.002 --> 00:27:08.904
It's like
a superhero's playground!

00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:14.565
No Sugar Bombs
on my watch.

00:27:17.637 --> 00:27:18.737
Where's Mom?

00:27:18.824 --> 00:27:19.667
She's up and out.

00:27:19.754 --> 00:27:21.546
She's at her new job
doing hero work.

00:27:21.633 --> 00:27:24.455
But I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:25.995
They are, for now.

00:27:26.082 --> 00:27:29.097
So Mom is getting paid
to break the law?

00:27:29.184 --> 00:27:30.388
She's not breaking

00:27:30.475 --> 00:27:32.757
She's an advocate
for superheroes.

00:27:32.844 --> 00:27:33.986
It's a new job.

00:27:34.073 --> 00:27:36.694
So, Mom is going out
illegally

00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:40.164
to explain why
she shouldn't be illegal.

00:27:40.251 --> 00:27:42.112
Hey Hey!

00:27:42.199 --> 00:27:43.568
The bus is here!

00:27:43.655 --> 00:27:47.560
Whoa! Grab your stuff quickly!
Go on, get on the

00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:50.556
Put your homework
in your pack!

00:27:51.455 --> 00:27:52.557
Bye-bye!

00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:01.030
We're gonna get along
just fine

00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:04.075
'cause you don't ask any hard questions.

00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:08.559
All right. All locations,

00:28:08.646 --> 00:28:09.935
we need to know
where you want us.

00:28:10.013 --> 00:28:11.021
Stand by.

00:28:11.108 --> 00:28:13.905
Seems strange
to wait for crime.

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:15.733
Relax.
You're smack in the middle

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.085
of the worst crime area in the city.
It's perfect.

00:28:19.172 --> 00:28:21.060
It's a superhero's playground.
"It's a superhero's

00:28:21.147 --> 00:28:22.451
playground." Right.

00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:24.249
You know,
after we went underground

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:26.382
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner

00:28:26.469 --> 00:28:27.812
waiting for something
to happen.

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:29.646
And I got mad at him
for it.

00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:32.921
Oh, I'm such a hypocrite.

00:28:33.008 --> 00:28:34.647
All units.
Something's up.

00:28:34.734 --> 00:28:36.088
We've been picking up
some chatter about

00:28:36.175 --> 00:28:38.827
potential disruptions to the
hovertrain's opening ceremony.

00:28:38.914 --> 00:28:41.279
Disruption or threat?
Both.

00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:43.249
Station's at Fifty Fourth
and Nottingham.

00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:44.973
A potential threat!
Perfect!

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.759
Fifty fourth and Nottingham.
Go, go, go!

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.770
Hey, Vi! I want you
back here by 10:30.

00:28:52.857 --> 00:28:53.731
11-ish?

00:28:53.818 --> 00:28:56.146
10-ish,
heading for 9:30-ish.

00:28:56.233 --> 00:28:58.287
10:30-ish it is.

00:28:58.374 --> 00:28:59.634
Enjoy the movie.

00:28:59.824 --> 00:29:01.923
"In the county of Noddoff

00:29:02.012 --> 00:29:04.083
"the Frubbers of Freep

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:09.665
"are all giving in
to the sweet succor of sleep."

00:29:18.743 --> 00:29:20.954
We will control the horizontal

00:29:21.267 --> 00:29:23.446
we will control the vertical.

00:29:29.328 --> 00:29:32.663
That's not the way
you're supposed to do it, Dad.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.075
They want us
to do it this way.

00:29:34.162 --> 00:29:37.296
I don't know that way!
Why would they change math?

00:29:37.383 --> 00:29:39.802
It's okay, Dad.
Math is math! Math is math!

00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:41.114
I'll just wait for Mom

00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:42.419
to get back.
What?

00:29:42.506 --> 00:29:45.362
She won't understand it
any better than I do

00:29:45.915 --> 00:29:47.678
The Outer Limits.

00:29:50.241 --> 00:29:51.577
"All over Doozle Dorf,

00:29:51.664 --> 00:29:54.298
"the Fribbers of Frupp
are going to sleep

00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:56.520
"'cause they just
can't keep up.

00:29:56.607 --> 00:30:00.169
"All over Doozle Dorf,
Doozles are dozing.

00:30:00.256 --> 00:30:04.295
"Eyelids so heavy,
they're drooping.

00:30:05.905 --> 00:30:07.725
"Closing! The point is:

00:30:07.812 --> 00:30:10.363
"Everyone,
everyone's hitting the sack!

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.563
"Everyone's getting the sleep
that they lack."

00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:16.270
Mayors often brag
about their cities

00:30:16.357 --> 00:30:18.582
and I'm no exception.

00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:19.958
And I'm willing to admit

00:30:20.045 --> 00:30:22.219
that New Urbem
is not the only city

00:30:22.306 --> 00:30:24.510
Are you sure the police are
gonna be okay with this?

00:30:24.597 --> 00:30:26.575
Sure. You're making
life easy for them.

00:30:26.662 --> 00:30:27.797
They still haven't
forgiven us

00:30:27.884 --> 00:30:29.537
for the last time we made
life easy for them.

00:30:29.624 --> 00:30:31.784
I know the Chief of Police.
There won't be a problem.

00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.084
With all due respect

00:30:33.171 --> 00:30:35.384
if you alone had handled
the Underminer

00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:37.189
things would have
been different.

00:30:37.276 --> 00:30:38.545
I'm just saying.

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:40.951
on budget
and ahead of schedule

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.343
to launch our magnificent
new hovertrain.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.018
It can get you
where you need to go

00:30:47.105 --> 00:30:48.987
at ridiculous speeds.

00:30:49.074 --> 00:30:52.377
The future is open
for business!

00:31:12.556 --> 00:31:14.045
Wait. The train has stopped.

00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:19.115
It's going
the wrong direction.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.552
It's going the wrong way.

00:31:21.639 --> 00:31:23.131
I'm going after it.

00:31:27.772 --> 00:31:30.185
This thing's really moving.

00:31:30.272 --> 00:31:32.904
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

00:31:34.012 --> 00:31:36.053
About 25 miles.

00:31:42.423 --> 00:31:45.305
No one can shut
this thing down?

00:31:45.392 --> 00:31:46.998
They've tried. No-go.

00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:50.553
Is that Elasti Girl?

00:31:57.183 --> 00:31:58.222
Overrides?

00:31:58.309 --> 00:31:59.936
They're locked out
of the system.

00:32:06.748 --> 00:32:09.553
What about a fail safe?
Not enough time.

00:32:12.325 --> 00:32:14.160
Someone's calling!
Switching over.

00:32:14.247 --> 00:32:16.018
Hey, Mom.
I can't find my high tops

00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:17.541
and Dad
can't find them either.

00:32:17.628 --> 00:32:19.721
But he won't call you
and ask, so I am.

00:32:19.808 --> 00:32:21.111
Do not call your mother!

00:32:21.198 --> 00:32:22.791
Dash, honey.
Can't talk right now.

00:32:22.878 --> 00:32:24.715
Look under your bed, okay.
How much time?

00:32:24.802 --> 00:32:26.577
Less than two minutes!

00:32:26.664 --> 00:32:28.839
There's a shortcut. Cut
through the culvert up ahead.

00:32:36.807 --> 00:32:39.139
I don't know
if I can stay with it.

00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:49.260
What the heck was that?

00:34:49.347 --> 00:34:51.424
Is everybody all right?
Is anybody injured?

00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:52.740
Are you all right?

00:34:56.081 --> 00:34:58.107
Your story better be good.

00:34:59.449 --> 00:35:01.644
Hey. Hey!

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.208
What happened?

00:35:36.653 --> 00:35:37.900
Honey, why are you

00:35:37.987 --> 00:35:40.631
Don't say anything.

00:35:44.795 --> 00:35:47.394
It's Dad.
Are you okay?

00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:50.447
I'm fine.
I don't wanna talk about it.

00:35:50.534 --> 00:35:52.105
Tony didn't even call?

00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:54.167
I don't wanna talk about it.

00:35:54.254 --> 00:35:55.826
Oh, honey
Dad!

00:35:55.913 --> 00:35:59.466
If you want me to feel better,
then leave me alone.

00:35:59.544 --> 00:36:00.574
Please?

00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:01.800
See, there's nothing

00:36:01.887 --> 00:36:02.853
a cop hates worse
than a missing child.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.162
My kid brother's son.
Today is his first birthday.

00:36:06.387 --> 00:36:09.185
Oh, but if anybody
can find that child, it's you, Roman.

00:36:09.528 --> 00:36:11.748
Because you're
a wonderful policeman.

00:36:12.157 --> 00:36:15.152
This is a holdup.

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:17.347
All right, get your hands up,
turn your back.

00:36:17.434 --> 00:36:18.447
Put your hands behind

00:36:18.534 --> 00:36:19.955
your heads
and keep them there!

00:36:20.042 --> 00:36:21.404
Don't move!

00:36:21.598 --> 00:36:23.974
Drop that.
All right, now get over there.

00:36:24.692 --> 00:36:26.521
Watch the door.

00:36:26.913 --> 00:36:28.795
You think I'm kiddin'?

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.712
Now.

00:36:36.222 --> 00:36:37.705
I said now!

00:36:37.792 --> 00:36:40.704
I got it!
Come on, I tell you, come on!

00:36:42.473 --> 00:36:44.050
You wanna get killed?

00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:42.721
Uh-oh.

00:38:18.192 --> 00:38:21.096
No, no, no!

00:38:24.055 --> 00:38:27.224
No!

00:38:27.368 --> 00:38:29.308
No, no, no.

00:38:29.395 --> 00:38:31.153
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:38:31.252 --> 00:38:34.201
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.323
You have powers!

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:46.924
Yeah, baby,

00:38:47.011 --> 00:38:48.993
and there's not
a scratch on you!

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.834
Did you go through
the locked door?

00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:53.182
Are those your powers?

00:38:53.269 --> 00:38:55.184
Who can multiply
like rabbits

00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:57.338
and go right through
any solid

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.991
Oh, my God!

00:39:09.934 --> 00:39:11.282
Hello?
Hey, honey.

00:39:11.369 --> 00:39:13.359
You weren't gonna call me?
Oh, hey!

00:39:13.446 --> 00:39:15.509
No. I mean, yes, yeah

00:39:15.596 --> 00:39:17.828
I just didn't wanna wake you.

00:39:17.915 --> 00:39:20.790
The strangest thing just
happened out in the yard.

00:39:20.877 --> 00:39:22.180
Sounds like I just
woke you up.

00:39:22.266 --> 00:39:23.048
No, no.

00:39:23.135 --> 00:39:25.236
It's just, Jack-Jack
He had an accident!

00:39:25.323 --> 00:39:26.134
I knew it!

00:39:26.221 --> 00:39:27.374
I'm coming home right now!
I never should have

00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:30.632
No, no, no, accident.
Stay there and finish your mission.

00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:32.876
You never should-should
wh-what?

00:39:32.963 --> 00:39:34.304
You don't think I can do this?
No, no.

00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:36.339
Sorry. I misspoke.

00:39:36.893 --> 00:39:38.062
Do you need me
to come back?

00:39:38.149 --> 00:39:41.130
No, no. No, I've got this.
Everything's great.

00:39:41.217 --> 00:39:42.961
What happened
with Jack-Jack?

00:39:44.035 --> 00:39:46.290
Nothing.
He's in excellent health.

00:39:46.377 --> 00:39:48.566
Well, that's good.

00:39:48.658 --> 00:39:50.830
How was Violet's date?
Uh

00:39:50.917 --> 00:39:52.656
That was tonight, right?

00:39:52.743 --> 00:39:55.299
Yes. Good.

00:39:55.442 --> 00:39:57.446
All fine and good.

00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:59.368
And Jack-Jack went down
with no trouble?

00:39:59.455 --> 00:40:01.273
Fine, yes, no trouble.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.898
And Dash got
his homework done?

00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:03.962
All done.

00:40:04.049 --> 00:40:05.524
So, things haven't
spiraled out

00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:06.757
of control
the moment I left?

00:40:06.844 --> 00:40:08.361
Amazing as it may seem,

00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:11.115
it has been
quite uneventful in fact.

00:40:11.202 --> 00:40:12.538
How about you?

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.558
I saved a runaway train!

00:40:17.001 --> 00:40:18.766
It was so great!

00:40:18.853 --> 00:40:21.108
The mayor was there to cut
the ribbon on this new train.

00:40:21.195 --> 00:40:22.986
Elasti Girl pursued the train

00:40:23.073 --> 00:40:25.133
and was able
to successfully activate

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.511
Blah, blah, blah. He says a
few words, cuts the ribbon

00:40:27.598 --> 00:40:28.530
and the train starts pulling

00:40:28.617 --> 00:40:30.266
out of the station
backwards

00:40:30.353 --> 00:40:32.358
track of its brand new hovertrain

00:40:32.445 --> 00:40:33.789
hovertrain malfunctioned

00:40:33.883 --> 00:40:35.157
thanking Elasti Girl

00:40:35.234 --> 00:40:36.226
..deemed to almost

00:40:36.304 --> 00:40:38.008
Superhero Elasti Girl

00:40:38.086 --> 00:40:38.943
Elasti Girl

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.344
Boom! No casualties!

00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:43.481
specialized motorbike,

00:40:43.568 --> 00:40:44.829
saving all of
the passengers

00:40:44.916 --> 00:40:46.028
One thing leads to another

00:40:46.115 --> 00:40:47.352
and suddenly,
I go after it!

00:40:47.439 --> 00:40:49.507
I'm telling you, honey,
it was a saga!

00:40:49.594 --> 00:40:51.687
That's fantastic, honey!

00:40:51.774 --> 00:40:53.898
And on your first night!

00:40:53.985 --> 00:40:57.149
I am so proud of you, really.

00:40:57.236 --> 00:40:58.593
I'm proud of you, honey.

00:40:58.701 --> 00:41:01.265
I know you want to get out
there and you will soon.

00:41:01.352 --> 00:41:03.270
And you'll be amazing.

00:41:03.357 --> 00:41:06.018
I couldn't have done this
if you hadn't taken over so well.

00:41:06.105 --> 00:41:07.917
Thanks for handling
everything.

00:41:08.004 --> 00:41:09.471
It's nothing.

00:41:09.558 --> 00:41:12.483
I love you, honey.
I'll be back soon.

00:41:12.654 --> 00:41:15.488
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams, honey.

00:41:31.872 --> 00:41:34.303
"Hey, Dad, it's okay.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.733
"I'll just wait for Mom
to get home."

00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:40.313
As if she could
I know how to

00:41:40.976 --> 00:41:42.866
I can do math.

00:41:51.995 --> 00:41:54.459
Oh, brother

00:41:57.235 --> 00:41:59.053
Wait for Mom!

00:42:00.338 --> 00:42:02.999
What am I,
a substitute parent?

00:42:05.376 --> 00:42:08.139
It's not my fault
they changed math.

00:42:16.053 --> 00:42:18.397
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:21.102
I think I understand
your math assignment.

00:42:21.189 --> 00:42:24.780
We still have some time
to finish it before your test.

00:42:24.873 --> 00:42:27.018
So first, you wanna put
all the numbers

00:42:27.105 --> 00:42:28.786
by themselves on one side.

00:42:28.873 --> 00:42:30.809
you change the sign.

00:42:30.896 --> 00:42:33.542
That means a plus becomes
a minus and a minus

00:42:33.629 --> 00:42:34.987
You got it?

00:42:35.074 --> 00:42:36.897
Yeah, baby!

00:42:50.227 --> 00:42:52.804
Oh. Uh, hello.

00:42:53.124 --> 00:42:54.686
We're in a new house.

00:42:54.773 --> 00:42:57.748
I did write my address
on your locker

00:42:57.835 --> 00:42:59.677
in permanent ink.

00:42:59.764 --> 00:43:01.901
Oh, is that what that is?

00:43:01.988 --> 00:43:03.476
Did you forget?

00:43:03.653 --> 00:43:05.858
Forget what?

00:43:06.182 --> 00:43:08.991
That's funny.

00:43:11.759 --> 00:43:13.423
Points for funny.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.723
Oh, was it
the weird outfit?

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:18.509
Because there's a reason.

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:20.418
I'm in a drama class

00:43:20.505 --> 00:43:22.888
and they just wanna do
Shakespeare

00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:25.409
but they're like,
"Try to make it relevant for the kids."

00:43:25.496 --> 00:43:27.746
So, like, "Oh, superheroes!
Kids love superheroes."

00:43:27.833 --> 00:43:29.028
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You wanna wear

00:43:29.115 --> 00:43:30.637
one kind of tights
and then they're like,

00:43:30.724 --> 00:43:32.036
"No, wear these
other kind of tights."

00:43:32.123 --> 00:43:34.249
Do I know you?

00:43:42.638 --> 00:43:44.942
Many say your speech
today is critical.

00:43:45.029 --> 00:43:47.538
Both sides just want the
best for their people.

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:50.960
We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.

00:43:51.115 --> 00:43:53.130
I haven't done this
in a while.

00:43:53.217 --> 00:43:55.606
This is good.
The train gives us momentum.

00:43:55.693 --> 00:43:57.775
Just go out there and
be your charming self

00:43:57.862 --> 00:43:59.221
and capitalize on it.

00:43:59.308 --> 00:44:01.610
Ms. Elasti Girl,
they're ready for you.

00:44:01.697 --> 00:44:03.819
Hey, stretch a leg.

00:44:05.255 --> 00:44:06.832
Thank you, Chad.
It was fun.

00:44:06.919 --> 00:44:09.924
Ambassador, your documents.
We're moving to the rooftop.

00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:12.280
Oh, Madame Ambassador,
hello!

00:44:12.403 --> 00:44:13.791
Oh, you are Elasti Girl!

00:44:13.878 --> 00:44:16.403
This is why now
I'm shaking your hand.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.698
It was so sad
when you went underground.

00:44:18.785 --> 00:44:22.326
I am glad to see you back
in your shiny outfit.

00:44:22.413 --> 00:44:24.207
That means so much
coming from you.

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:25.926
Good luck with your speech.
This way, Ambassador.

00:44:26.004 --> 00:44:27.815
Uh, uh. Bring lasting peace!

00:44:27.902 --> 00:44:29.774
I will,
when you defeat evil.

00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:31.733
Okay.

00:44:31.847 --> 00:44:33.850
Three, two

00:44:34.392 --> 00:44:35.793
For over 15 years,

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.448
superheroes have been
in hiding.

00:44:37.535 --> 00:44:39.035
Forced into it
by a society

00:44:39.122 --> 00:44:40.895
no longer willing
to support them.

00:44:40.982 --> 00:44:42.315
That may soon be changing

00:44:42.402 --> 00:44:45.090
due to a growing movement
to bring the Supers back.

00:44:45.177 --> 00:44:46.792
Here, fresh on the heels
of her own

00:44:46.879 --> 00:44:48.815
heroic save
of a runaway train

00:44:48.902 --> 00:44:52.176
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elasti Girl.

00:44:52.263 --> 00:44:53.621
Welcome!
Hello, Chad.

00:44:53.708 --> 00:44:55.887
All the polls are going
in your direction.

00:44:55.974 --> 00:44:57.468
That's true.
Things are good

00:44:57.555 --> 00:44:58.762
Hello.

00:44:58.849 --> 00:45:00.464
Uh, hello?

00:45:00.551 --> 00:45:02.647
Do I have your attention?

00:45:02.734 --> 00:45:03.975
Yes, Chad.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:05.314
Of course I do.

00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:07.089
I'm appearing
on your screen.

00:45:07.176 --> 00:45:10.057
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

00:45:10.144 --> 00:45:11.990
Screens are everywhere.

00:45:12.077 --> 00:45:13.692
We are controlled by screens.

00:45:15.402 --> 00:45:20.117
And screens
are controlled by me

00:45:20.204 --> 00:45:21.792
Screenslaver.

00:45:21.879 --> 00:45:22.789
Hey!

00:45:22.876 --> 00:45:24.588
I control this broadcast

00:45:24.675 --> 00:45:27.905
and this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.

00:45:27.992 --> 00:45:29.912
What's wrong with him?
The signal's been hijacked.

00:45:29.999 --> 00:45:32.027
I'll check it out.
Don't look at any monitors.

00:45:32.114 --> 00:45:34.454
I could hijack
the ambassador's aerocade

00:45:34.603 --> 00:45:36.841
while it's still airborne.

00:45:36.928 --> 00:45:38.718
Right, Elasti Girl?

00:45:40.725 --> 00:45:43.422
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.528
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Elasti Girl?

00:45:57.615 --> 00:45:59.338
Which one?

00:46:07.752 --> 00:46:09.567
Elasti Girl!
What are you doing here?

00:46:09.654 --> 00:46:12.010
The ambassador is in danger.
Which chopper is she

00:46:12.097 --> 00:46:13.524
Look out!

00:46:14.993 --> 00:46:17.456
Follow them
and get me close!

00:46:19.864 --> 00:46:22.762
Get out of the sky,
and touch down safely!

00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:35.159
Stand down! It's Elasti Girl.

00:46:35.246 --> 00:46:36.942
Stay in your seat, ma'am!

00:46:43.521 --> 00:46:45.518
We're under attack!

00:46:45.605 --> 00:46:48.563
Quick, go!
Protect the ambassador!

00:46:51.997 --> 00:46:53.232
Open the door!

00:46:53.319 --> 00:46:54.632
Do as she says!

00:46:56.534 --> 00:46:57.655
Can you all swim?

00:46:57.742 --> 00:46:59.398
Yeah.
No!

00:47:20.624 --> 00:47:23.529
We're gonna have
to slingshot! Hang on!

00:47:29.976 --> 00:47:32.731
Are you all right, ma'am?

00:47:32.818 --> 00:47:34.703
I'm perfectly fine

00:47:36.763 --> 00:47:38.719
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Oh!

00:47:44.548 --> 00:47:47.043
Boys are jerks
and superheroes suck.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.130
Good morning!

00:47:48.217 --> 00:47:50.574
He takes one look
at me in that suit

00:47:50.661 --> 00:47:54.295
and decides to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

00:47:54.382 --> 00:47:56.209
Well.
He's protecting himself.

00:47:56.296 --> 00:47:59.302
If he really did see you,
it's best that he forget.

00:47:59.389 --> 00:48:00.402
It's better for you, too.

00:48:00.489 --> 00:48:03.224
Um. I can't I can't tell you
how many memories

00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:05.012
Dicker's had to erase
over the years

00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:07.303
when someone figured out

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.246
your mother's
or my identity.

00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:11.842
It was Dicker!

00:48:11.929 --> 00:48:14.145
You told him about Tony!
Honey

00:48:14.232 --> 00:48:17.164
You had me erased
from Tony's mind!

00:48:30.394 --> 00:48:32.117
I hate superheroes!

00:48:32.204 --> 00:48:34.493
And I renounce them!

00:48:40.437 --> 00:48:42.119
I renounce them!

00:48:51.016 --> 00:48:52.983
Is she having adolescence?

00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:55.811
A new report out today shows that,

00:48:55.898 --> 00:48:57.586
when it comes
to decision making

00:48:57.673 --> 00:48:59.202
people have more trust
in a monkey

00:48:59.289 --> 00:49:00.882
throwing darts than Congress.

00:49:00.969 --> 00:49:03.032
What's going on, Tommy?
A protest?

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:04.941
They're here in support.

00:49:05.028 --> 00:49:07.266
Support?
Support of what?

00:49:07.353 --> 00:49:09.881
Well, in support of you.

00:49:12.484 --> 00:49:14.986
Wow. Oh, hey

00:49:15.073 --> 00:49:17.697
Thanks for coming out.
Hi.

00:49:17.784 --> 00:49:20.430
Oh, my goodness.
Thanks so much.

00:49:20.517 --> 00:49:21.603
Oh, hello.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:23.207
What does your sign say?

00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:29.040
Ka-boom! Ka-pow!

00:49:29.127 --> 00:49:31.535
Supers should be legal now!

00:49:31.622 --> 00:49:33.945
Talk to ya.
Oh, what do ya know!

00:49:34.032 --> 00:49:35.017
Ellenwood.

00:49:35.104 --> 00:49:37.134
Oh, now you wanna
return my calls

00:49:37.221 --> 00:49:38.364
about superheroes, huh?

00:49:38.451 --> 00:49:40.361
Oh. I'll have to
call you back.

00:49:40.448 --> 00:49:41.445
Oh, that felt good.

00:49:41.532 --> 00:49:42.760
Felicia, hold my calls,
please.

00:49:42.847 --> 00:49:44.525
Eh! Hey!
It's working!

00:49:44.612 --> 00:49:46.583
Hey, the ambassador
made a big speech

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:47.870
about superheroes today.

00:49:47.957 --> 00:49:49.251
Turns out
saving someone's life

00:49:49.338 --> 00:49:51.242
makes a good impression on them.
Who knew, huh?

00:49:51.329 --> 00:49:53.530
I'm getting calls
from all over the world.

00:49:53.617 --> 00:49:56.080
Media awareness
is up 72%.

00:49:56.167 --> 00:49:58.070
The push
for superhero legalization

00:49:58.157 --> 00:50:00.126
is becoming
a worldwide movement!

00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:02.047
I have big plans
for our next move.

00:50:02.134 --> 00:50:03.869
We're gonna have
a summit at sea.

00:50:03.956 --> 00:50:05.055
We'll use our ship

00:50:05.142 --> 00:50:07.361
we'll gather leaders
and Supers

00:50:07.448 --> 00:50:09.605
from all over the world.
That's great.

00:50:09.724 --> 00:50:10.940
I'm happy.

00:50:11.042 --> 00:50:12.650
I'm happy
the numbers are up.

00:50:12.737 --> 00:50:15.646
I'm happy the ambassador
is pro superhero

00:50:15.733 --> 00:50:17.414
and I'm happy
you're happy.

00:50:17.501 --> 00:50:19.126
I'm hearing that you're happy,

00:50:19.213 --> 00:50:20.640
but
why am I not feeling it?

00:50:20.727 --> 00:50:22.118
Because I didn't get him!

00:50:22.205 --> 00:50:23.765
Screenslaver
is still out there.

00:50:23.852 --> 00:50:26.621
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

00:50:26.744 --> 00:50:27.848
He's gonna want more

00:50:27.935 --> 00:50:30.142
and as long as
he gets to play, he wins.

00:50:30.229 --> 00:50:31.973
One thing
I've learned in business?

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.878
Smell the flowers.

00:50:33.965 --> 00:50:35.314
They don't bloom that often.

00:50:35.401 --> 00:50:37.047
What do you want
on your tombstone?

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:38.314
"She worried a lot"?

00:50:38.401 --> 00:50:40.082
All right, stop talking.

00:50:40.478 --> 00:50:41.807
Show her.

00:50:46.771 --> 00:50:49.687
This is just so exciting, isn't it?
Huh?

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:53.707
Oh, wow. Uh

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:56.924
Wow! Elasti Girl,
there you are.

00:50:57.011 --> 00:50:58.360
Hello.
I didn't

00:50:58.447 --> 00:50:59.494
Wow!

00:50:59.581 --> 00:51:01.731
Come on, get yourself
together, Karen.

00:51:02.276 --> 00:51:05.228
Hi, my superhero name
is Voyd.

00:51:05.315 --> 00:51:08.744
I just wanna thank you,
for, like, for being you!

00:51:08.831 --> 00:51:11.097
I'm just no, I just like the

00:51:11.503 --> 00:51:14.942
Okay, what I can do,
um, is this.

00:51:19.797 --> 00:51:21.864
Yeah.

00:51:21.951 --> 00:51:25.549
That is impressive.
Very interdimensional.

00:51:25.636 --> 00:51:27.665
I felt like
an outcast before.

00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:32.272
But now, with you being
you, I feel like

00:51:33.933 --> 00:51:35.136
Yay, me.

00:51:36.104 --> 00:51:38.111
I flew them in
from all over.

00:51:38.198 --> 00:51:40.041
They've all been
in hiding.

00:51:40.128 --> 00:51:42.107
They have powers,
secret identities

00:51:42.194 --> 00:51:44.582
and names
they've given themselves.

00:51:45.032 --> 00:51:47.260
I'm Screech.
It's a pleasure.

00:51:47.347 --> 00:51:48.461
I've always considered you

00:51:48.548 --> 00:51:50.664
the gold standard
for superheroes.

00:51:50.751 --> 00:51:52.789
Well, thanks.
You're too nice.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.678
I am called Brick.

00:51:54.765 --> 00:51:57.977
Nice to meet you, Brick.
Uh, where are you from?

00:51:58.064 --> 00:51:59.437
Wisconsin.

00:51:59.531 --> 00:52:02.908
Oh. Elasti Girl.
I assume your powers are

00:52:02.995 --> 00:52:05.228
You know,
zapping things electrically

00:52:05.315 --> 00:52:07.664
charging things, bolts of lightning,
that kind of stuff.

00:52:07.751 --> 00:52:08.861
Name's Reflux.

00:52:08.948 --> 00:52:11.821
Medical condition or
superpower, you decide.

00:52:11.908 --> 00:52:13.630
That's a little line

00:52:13.717 --> 00:52:15.244
I say just to put
people at ease.

00:52:15.331 --> 00:52:17.040
Hope I don't offend.
Oh, no, no, no.

00:52:17.127 --> 00:52:18.321
Reflux. Love it.

00:52:19.851 --> 00:52:22.679
Well, I do look forward
to working with you.

00:52:22.766 --> 00:52:25.533
Yes, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

00:52:27.098 --> 00:52:28.652
Ow!

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.953
Well, I'm beat. Congratulations.
Big day.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.628
Good night, ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

00:52:37.715 --> 00:52:38.814
Good night.

00:52:38.901 --> 00:52:40.291
Must be nice for you,

00:52:40.378 --> 00:52:42.200
being out front
after all this time.

00:52:42.287 --> 00:52:43.377
Out front?

00:52:43.464 --> 00:52:46.533
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.314
and even then,
you were kind of

00:52:48.401 --> 00:52:49.813
in Mr. Incredible's
shadow.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.102
Nah, I beg to differ.

00:52:51.189 --> 00:52:53.346
I'm not I'm not
saying you weren't big.

00:52:53.433 --> 00:52:55.213
No, you were,
and are, a superstar

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.533
but you have the stage
to yourself now.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.166
And people have
to pay attention.

00:53:00.253 --> 00:53:01.953
Oh, you mean,
"It's a man's world" and all that?

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.747
Well, what world
do you live in?

00:53:03.834 --> 00:53:05.063
Your brother runs DEVTECH.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:09.682
I don't want his job.
I invent, he sells.

00:53:09.769 --> 00:53:12.789
I ask you,
which of us has the greater influence?

00:53:12.876 --> 00:53:14.274
Which side of me
are you asking?

00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:15.711
The believer or the cynic?

00:53:15.798 --> 00:53:17.486
The cynic
Would say selling

00:53:17.573 --> 00:53:18.868
is more important, because

00:53:18.955 --> 00:53:20.849
the best sellers
have the most buyers.

00:53:20.936 --> 00:53:22.328
Doesn't matter
what you're selling.

00:53:22.415 --> 00:53:24.461
It only matters
what people buy.

00:53:24.548 --> 00:53:25.588
This is true.

00:53:25.675 --> 00:53:28.150
If I discovered the
origin of the universe

00:53:28.237 --> 00:53:29.524
my brother
would find a way

00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:32.524
to market it as a,
uh, foot massager.

00:53:34.999 --> 00:53:36.814
So, what would
the believer say?

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:39.525
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

00:53:39.612 --> 00:53:41.618
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

00:53:41.705 --> 00:53:43.502
and impose your will
on the status quo.

00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:45.032
Sounds like my brother.
What?

00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:46.274
You sound like my brother.

00:53:46.361 --> 00:53:47.494
Well, he's not wrong.

00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:49.134
There is an art
to getting a reaction

00:53:49.221 --> 00:53:51.000
Oh! I know how to get him.

00:53:51.087 --> 00:53:54.010
My brother?
No. Screenslaver!

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:56.485
You're tech savvy.
I need to lock onto a signal

00:53:56.572 --> 00:53:57.768
and trace its origin.

00:53:57.855 --> 00:53:59.268
How fast
can you slap something together

00:53:59.355 --> 00:54:00.618
and meet me at the airport?
Airport?

00:54:00.705 --> 00:54:02.204
Need to go
out of town, pronto.

00:54:02.291 --> 00:54:04.243
I can get your contraption
together by 5:00 a.m.

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:06.144
I need to get on TV.
Chad!

00:54:06.231 --> 00:54:08.094
I'll get my brother to set up
an exclusive with him

00:54:08.181 --> 00:54:09.181
tonight on the newscast.

00:54:09.268 --> 00:54:11.469
Finish our interview by phone!
Promote the hell out of it.

00:54:11.556 --> 00:54:13.196
Independence
from Screenslavery!

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:15.981
Chad tonight.
Boom!

00:54:19.315 --> 00:54:20.724
Dicker.
Yeah, hey, Rick.

00:54:20.811 --> 00:54:22.433
You remember that kid
I mentioned to you?

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.556
Tony Rydinger.

00:54:23.643 --> 00:54:25.334
Mind wipe?
Yeah, nice kid.

00:54:25.421 --> 00:54:27.031
Well, you also wiped out

00:54:27.118 --> 00:54:29.140
the Friday night date
my daughter had with him.

00:54:29.227 --> 00:54:31.516
In fact,
you wiped out my daughter.

00:54:31.603 --> 00:54:33.938
Oops.
Not an exact science, Bob.

00:54:34.025 --> 00:54:35.703
Rick, you gotta help me here.

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.843
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.452
I gotta fix this.
What do you know about Tony?

00:54:41.539 --> 00:54:42.847
Um

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.112
Not much.

00:54:44.216 --> 00:54:45.829
Seems like a good kid.

00:54:45.916 --> 00:54:48.041
Popular,
plays sports, music.

00:54:48.128 --> 00:54:50.016
Parents own The Happy Platter,

00:54:50.103 --> 00:54:51.923
kid works there part time.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.442
Happy Platter?

00:54:56.639 --> 00:54:59.125
Why did we drive
all the way across town

00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:01.135
for The Happy Platter?

00:55:01.222 --> 00:55:02.883
We'd like a booth over there,

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.525
near the philodendron.

00:55:04.755 --> 00:55:06.984
Good, right?
Near the philodendron.

00:55:09.284 --> 00:55:12.164
This platter doesn't look
all that happy to me.

00:55:12.251 --> 00:55:14.017
It looks bored.

00:55:14.104 --> 00:55:16.299
Ha-ha!
The Bored Platter!

00:55:16.386 --> 00:55:18.704
I thought Vi would want
a change of pace

00:55:18.791 --> 00:55:21.751
from drive in food.
I like drive in food.

00:55:21.838 --> 00:55:23.431
Does this mean vegetables?

00:55:23.518 --> 00:55:25.907
A balanced diet
means vegetables, kiddo.

00:55:25.994 --> 00:55:27.442
Get used to it.

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.063
Good evening, everyone.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.379
Oh, no!

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:33.064
Is she all right?
Violet, are you okay?

00:55:33.151 --> 00:55:34.350
Nothing to see here.

00:55:34.437 --> 00:55:36.033
Yeah, more napkins would be good.
I'm fine,

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.275
I'm fine.
It happens all the time here.

00:55:37.362 --> 00:55:39.016
Mops it right up.
Normally, she doesn't

00:55:39.103 --> 00:55:40.535
ever drip like this.

00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:43.407
Would you like water, sir?
Yes.

00:55:43.494 --> 00:55:46.150
Yes, I would.
This is my daughter

00:55:46.237 --> 00:55:47.919
who you must know, right?
God. Stop.

00:55:48.006 --> 00:55:49.232
Hello.
Violet.

00:55:49.319 --> 00:55:50.314
Hello, Violet.

00:55:51.509 --> 00:55:53.024
Hey, Vi, say hi to

00:55:53.111 --> 00:55:54.728
Don't push it, Dad.

00:55:54.815 --> 00:55:56.274
I'm Dash,
her little brother.

00:55:56.361 --> 00:55:57.393
Hello.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.868
Mmm.
This is really good water.

00:55:59.955 --> 00:56:01.197
It's very refreshing.

00:56:01.284 --> 00:56:02.407
Spring water, is it?

00:56:02.494 --> 00:56:05.096
I don't know, sir.
I think it's tap.

00:56:05.183 --> 00:56:06.711
Well, it is very good.

00:56:06.798 --> 00:56:08.105
Excellent tap.

00:56:08.192 --> 00:56:09.808
Excuse me.

00:56:10.247 --> 00:56:12.136
Well, nice to meet you.

00:56:12.223 --> 00:56:13.903
Where'd she go?
Mmm.

00:56:14.043 --> 00:56:15.996
To find a good place
to be angry?

00:56:17.151 --> 00:56:19.984
Tonight, we go now
to a special remote interview

00:56:20.071 --> 00:56:21.135
with Elasti Girl.

00:56:21.222 --> 00:56:22.407
How you feeling, Chad?

00:56:22.494 --> 00:56:23.488
You doing all right?

00:56:23.575 --> 00:56:25.883
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.970
I have no memory of the event.

00:56:28.057 --> 00:56:29.852
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty strange

00:56:29.939 --> 00:56:31.422
to see a recording
of yourself

00:56:31.509 --> 00:56:33.824
the night before
and have no recollection.

00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:35.680
I don't think
anyone needs to worry.

00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:37.947
We've taken many precautions
tonight though.

00:56:38.034 --> 00:56:39.196
Where are you right now?

00:56:39.283 --> 00:56:42.322
On a case, in a secure
undisclosed location.

00:56:42.409 --> 00:56:43.940
I wanna talk about you

00:56:44.027 --> 00:56:46.555
starting with your save
of a runaway train.

00:56:46.642 --> 00:56:48.752
Here's an exclusive
unedited clip

00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:50.285
from your own suit cam.

00:56:50.372 --> 00:56:51.459
Roll the clip.

00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:53.848
This thing's really moving.

00:56:54.032 --> 00:56:56.861
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

00:56:56.987 --> 00:56:58.887
About 25 miles.

00:56:59.737 --> 00:57:02.844
The Screenslaver
interrupts this program

00:57:02.931 --> 00:57:04.379
for an important announcement.

00:57:04.466 --> 00:57:06.424
I'll be damned. She knew.

00:57:06.511 --> 00:57:08.259
Let's see
if your gadget works.

00:57:08.346 --> 00:57:10.344
Don't bother
watching the rest.

00:57:10.431 --> 00:57:11.330
Gotcha!

00:57:11.417 --> 00:57:14.000
Elasti Girl doesn't
save the day.

00:57:14.087 --> 00:57:17.035
She only postpones
her defeat.

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:19.282
And while she postpones
her defeat

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:22.227
you eat chips and
watch her confront problems

00:57:22.314 --> 00:57:24.957
that you are too lazy
to deal with.

00:57:25.296 --> 00:57:28.086
Superheroes are
part of your brainless desire

00:57:28.173 --> 00:57:31.396
to replace true experience
with simulation.

00:57:31.831 --> 00:57:34.707
You don't talk,
you watch talk shows.

00:57:34.939 --> 00:57:38.176
You don't play games,
you watch game shows.

00:57:38.468 --> 00:57:41.606
Travel, relationships, risk

00:57:41.987 --> 00:57:44.805
every meaningful experience
must be packaged

00:57:44.892 --> 00:57:47.832
and delivered to you
to watch at a distance.

00:57:48.086 --> 00:57:50.465
So that you can remain
ever sheltered

00:57:50.552 --> 00:57:52.090
ever passive

00:57:52.193 --> 00:57:54.408
ever ravenous consumers

00:57:54.495 --> 00:57:57.817
who can't bring themselves
to rise from their couches

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.551
break a sweat
and participate in life.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.575
You want superheroes
to protect you

00:58:04.662 --> 00:58:08.809
and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process.

00:58:08.973 --> 00:58:12.051
While you tell yourselves
you're being looked after.

00:58:12.158 --> 00:58:14.386
That your interests
are being served.

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:17.523
And your rights
are being upheld.

00:58:17.712 --> 00:58:20.744
So that the system can
keep stealing from you

00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:23.440
smiling at you all the while.

00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:26.935
Go ahead,
send your Supers to stop me.

00:58:27.022 --> 00:58:29.703
Grab your snacks,
watch your screens,

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:31.252
and see what happens.

00:58:31.668 --> 00:58:34.713
You are no longer in control.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.395
I am.

01:00:17.835 --> 01:00:19.526
Find anything?

01:01:10.288 --> 01:01:11.917
Sorry!

01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:45.156
What happened?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.988
What happened is
you destroyed my evidence.

01:01:48.392 --> 01:01:50.074
What's going on?
What did I do?

01:01:50.161 --> 01:01:51.649
What did you guys do to me?

01:01:51.736 --> 01:01:54.261
That's right, punk.
Blame the system.

01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:57.226
Your tracker worked
like a charm, Evelyn.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:59.326
You're a genius.
Aw, shucks!

01:01:59.413 --> 01:02:02.004
I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

01:02:02.092 --> 01:02:04.727
Hey, Dad.

01:02:04.814 --> 01:02:08.759
We're doing fractions
and denismals and percentages

01:02:08.846 --> 01:02:10.806
and I don't get 'em.
Aren't you

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.149
Didn't we get all caught up?

01:02:12.236 --> 01:02:13.500
Yeah, we were caught up

01:02:13.587 --> 01:02:16.873
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.079
Decimals.

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:19.656
the addition of the Incredibile,

01:02:19.743 --> 01:02:20.773
the super car

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:24.064
once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.

01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:26.781
It's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.880
They said it was
beyond repair.

01:02:28.967 --> 01:02:30.521
Hey, it was in perfect condition.

01:02:30.608 --> 01:02:32.216
You used to
drive that?

01:02:32.303 --> 01:02:33.824
They said it was destroyed.

01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:35.586
Long thought lost
or destroyed,

01:02:35.673 --> 01:02:37.804
the famous car
turned up at private auction.

01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:39.245
They said it was

01:02:39.332 --> 01:02:41.235
That's my car!

01:02:49.253 --> 01:02:51.635
Stupid water feature!

01:02:51.722 --> 01:02:54.742
This car is just loaded
with amazing gadgets.

01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:57.686
Care to demonstrate?
I'd love to, but we haven't figured out

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.328
how to make them work yet.

01:03:01.332 --> 01:03:04.151
Wow! It works?

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:06.663
Huh?

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.503
What are you doing?
This is not a toy!

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:10.816
That's a rocket launcher!

01:03:10.903 --> 01:03:12.697
Sweet! Which one launches
the rocket?

01:03:12.784 --> 01:03:14.325
Hey!
This is not your car!

01:03:14.412 --> 01:03:16.338
It's not your car, either!
It is so!

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:17.461
It's the Incredibile.

01:03:17.548 --> 01:03:19.417
Why's that guy have it?
He shouldn't!

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:21.166
Launch the rockets!
Launch the rockets!

01:03:21.253 --> 01:03:22.699
Launch the rockets!
I'm not

01:03:22.786 --> 01:03:23.863
launching anything!
Launch the rockets!

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:25.221
Do you think I want an angry
I wanna blow it up!

01:03:25.308 --> 01:03:26.980
Rich guy coming after me
right now

01:03:27.067 --> 01:03:28.785
when I'm trying not to
I'm not sure

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:30.002
what's happened here, Mark.
..distract

01:03:30.089 --> 01:03:31.192
But everyone here has scattered
..your

01:03:31.279 --> 01:03:32.346
and I'm afraid I'll need to move
..mother.

01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:33.908
At any minute.

01:03:33.995 --> 01:03:36.037
Rich guy got my car.

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:40.417
So, you're not gonna
steal your car

01:03:40.504 --> 01:03:42.002
back from the rich guy?

01:03:50.895 --> 01:03:52.400
What the heck is that?

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.275
Jack-Jack has powers?

01:03:58.362 --> 01:03:59.503
Well, yeah, but

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:01.308
You knew about this?
Yeah.

01:04:01.395 --> 01:04:02.970
Why didn't you tell us?
I don't know.

01:04:03.057 --> 01:04:04.870
We're your kids.
We need to know

01:04:04.957 --> 01:04:06.338
these things.
Did you tell Mom?

01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:08.198
No. Your mother
Why not?

01:04:08.285 --> 01:04:09.705
You'd want us to tell you,
wouldn't you? Is not talking

01:04:09.792 --> 01:04:12.019
Why would you not tell Mom?
Because I didn't wanna

01:04:12.106 --> 01:04:14.127
What? Come on, man.
Because it's not the time.

01:04:14.214 --> 01:04:16.142
Why?
Because So uncool!

01:04:16.229 --> 01:04:18.489
Because I'm formulating, okay?

01:04:18.576 --> 01:04:21.253
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing!

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.419
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend

01:04:23.506 --> 01:04:26.197
and keeping the baby from
turning into a flaming monster!

01:04:26.284 --> 01:04:27.701
How do I do it?

01:04:28.278 --> 01:04:30.586
By rolling with
the punches, baby!

01:04:30.673 --> 01:04:33.088
I eat thunder
and crap lightning, okay?

01:04:33.175 --> 01:04:34.978
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible!

01:04:35.065 --> 01:04:38.412
Not Mr. So-So
or Mr. Mediocre Guy.

01:04:38.514 --> 01:04:41.152
Mr. Incredible!

01:04:42.718 --> 01:04:44.654
We should call Lucius.

01:04:44.782 --> 01:04:46.542
No. I can handle it.

01:04:46.629 --> 01:04:48.893
There's no way I'm gonna

01:04:57.949 --> 01:04:59.408
Dada.

01:05:00.518 --> 01:05:02.178
I'm calling Lucius.

01:05:06.165 --> 01:05:08.679
Looks normal to me.
When did this start happening?

01:05:08.766 --> 01:05:10.607
Since Helen got the job.

01:05:10.694 --> 01:05:12.600
I assume she knows?
Are you kidding?

01:05:12.687 --> 01:05:14.102
I can't tell her
about this,

01:05:14.189 --> 01:05:15.742
not while she's doing
hero work!

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.194
Mama!
Girls, come on.

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:19.080
Leave the saving the world
to the men?

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:20.807
I don't think so.
Mama!

01:05:21.053 --> 01:05:22.794
I've got to succeed!

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:24.508
So she can succeed.

01:05:24.595 --> 01:05:27.336
So we can succeed!
I get it, Bob!

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:30.108
I get it.
When was the last time you slept?

01:05:30.195 --> 01:05:31.733
Who keeps track of that?

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.297
Besides, he's a baby.

01:05:33.384 --> 01:05:35.639
I can handle it,
I got this handled.

01:05:35.726 --> 01:05:37.766
So, you good then?

01:05:37.853 --> 01:05:40.108
You got everything
under control? Right?

01:05:42.579 --> 01:05:43.664
What the?

01:05:44.945 --> 01:05:47.596
Cookie!
Cha Cha want a cookie?

01:05:47.683 --> 01:05:50.554
Num-num cookie?
Cha Cha wanna num-num?

01:05:50.641 --> 01:05:53.317
Num-num cookie! Cookie!

01:05:53.404 --> 01:05:54.592
You're not
Cookie!

01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:55.871
Oh, my God!
Cookie!

01:05:55.958 --> 01:05:57.597
Dada! Dada. Dada.
Whoa.

01:05:57.684 --> 01:05:59.371
Okay! Okay.

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:01.206
So, he can still
hear you

01:06:01.293 --> 01:06:03.599
from the
From the other dimension, yeah.

01:06:03.686 --> 01:06:05.799
That is freaky.
I mean, that's not like

01:06:05.886 --> 01:06:08.847
Not like our other kids.
No, it is not.

01:06:08.934 --> 01:06:11.542
Full powers, totally random.

01:06:11.629 --> 01:06:13.878
So now, he's what?
Is he good?

01:06:13.965 --> 01:06:16.019
Yeah, you'd think so,
right?

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:18.892
Obviously,
I can't keep giving him cookies!

01:06:18.979 --> 01:06:20.934
Uh-uh?
But if I stop

01:06:24.635 --> 01:06:26.745
Ahhh! He is freaking!
Again, he is freaking!

01:06:26.832 --> 01:06:28.106
No biting the daddy!

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.655
What the?
No biting!

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.717
Okay.

01:06:38.736 --> 01:06:41.839
I think I just need
a little bit of me time.

01:06:41.926 --> 01:06:43.213
Then I'll be good to go.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.668
Oh, you need
more than me time, Bob.

01:06:45.755 --> 01:06:47.512
You need
major life realignment

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:48.879
on a number of levels.

01:06:48.966 --> 01:06:51.250
Starting with
baby superfreak here!

01:06:51.337 --> 01:06:55.584
You need some solid
outside the box thinking.

01:07:03.877 --> 01:07:05.486
Galbaki?

01:07:05.643 --> 01:07:09.626
Elasti Girl's supersuit
is by Galbaki?

01:07:09.713 --> 01:07:11.202
Explain yourself!

01:07:14.442 --> 01:07:17.073
Oh, my God.
You're worse than I thought.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.026
It's the baby.
I brought the baby.

01:07:21.895 --> 01:07:24.024
Oh, highly unusual.

01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:33.091
You look ghastly, Robert.

01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:35.045
I haven't been sleeping.

01:07:35.388 --> 01:07:38.871
I broke my daughter,
they keep changing math

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:42.298
we needed double-A batteries,
but I got triple-A's

01:07:42.385 --> 01:07:44.957
and now we still need
double-A batteries.

01:07:45.044 --> 01:07:47.143
I put one red thing
in a load of whites

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.344
and now
everything's pink.

01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:50.817
And I think
we need eggs.

01:07:50.904 --> 01:07:54.611
Done properly,
parenting is a heroic act.

01:07:54.698 --> 01:07:56.090
Done properly.

01:07:56.177 --> 01:07:59.199
I am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me.

01:07:59.286 --> 01:08:01.057
But you do not come to me

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:03.319
for eggs and batteries,
Robert.

01:08:03.498 --> 01:08:04.916
I design herowear

01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:07.479
and Elasti Girl
must have a new suit.

01:08:07.566 --> 01:08:10.055
Actually, it's Jack-Jack.

01:08:10.142 --> 01:08:13.083
You also wish
a new suit for the baby?

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:16.629
I would hardly classify
this as an emergency.

01:08:16.716 --> 01:08:19.831
Well, he's a special case.
Worth studying.

01:08:19.918 --> 01:08:21.837
If I could just leave him
with you

01:08:21.924 --> 01:08:23.982
for a while
Leave him? Here?

01:08:24.462 --> 01:08:27.090
I am not a baby person,
Robert.

01:08:27.177 --> 01:08:30.001
I have no baby facilities.
I am an artist.

01:08:30.088 --> 01:08:33.963
I do not involve myself
in the prosaic day-to-day to

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:35.363
day.

01:08:38.736 --> 01:08:40.799
Fascinating!

01:08:42.445 --> 01:08:45.193
AA-Are you seeing this, Robert?

01:08:46.275 --> 01:08:47.769
Dada.

01:08:56.852 --> 01:08:59.883
Oh, my God.

01:09:00.558 --> 01:09:01.807
Yes!

01:09:02.152 --> 01:09:03.853
Of course you can leave
the baby overnight.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.815
I'm sure filling in
for Helen is challenging,

01:09:05.902 --> 01:09:06.799
and you are very tired

01:09:06.886 --> 01:09:07.917
and the other children
need you

01:09:08.004 --> 01:09:09.298
and miss you,
and you must go to them.

01:09:09.385 --> 01:09:10.954
Auntie Edna will take care
of everything

01:09:11.041 --> 01:09:13.903
so, drive safely and goodbye.
I enjoy our visits.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.222
"Auntie Edna"?

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:25.045
Attention. Attention.

01:09:25.253 --> 01:09:27.736
I wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight

01:09:27.823 --> 01:09:29.313
in support of superheroes

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.525
and bringing them
back into society!

01:09:32.612 --> 01:09:34.274
You all made it happen.

01:09:34.361 --> 01:09:35.699
The need for this
has been made

01:09:35.786 --> 01:09:37.228
crystal clear
in recent days

01:09:37.315 --> 01:09:39.150
with bad actors
like the self proclaimed

01:09:39.237 --> 01:09:41.219
Screenslaver
threatening our peace.

01:09:41.306 --> 01:09:42.861
His reign was short, huh?

01:09:42.948 --> 01:09:45.014
And thanks to this woman

01:09:45.101 --> 01:09:48.071
a great super. You love her.
You missed her.

01:09:48.158 --> 01:09:51.528
Welcome back, Elasti Girl.

01:09:51.967 --> 01:09:54.111
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

01:09:54.198 --> 01:09:56.434
Come on. Get up here.

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.059
I want you to have this.

01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.394
A memento.

01:10:01.852 --> 01:10:05.345
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
and everyone at DEVTECH.

01:10:05.432 --> 01:10:07.182
I am forever in your debt.

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:08.828
And thanks to all of you,

01:10:08.915 --> 01:10:11.817
your pressure
changed all the right minds.

01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:14.618
We've made amazing headway
in a very short time

01:10:14.705 --> 01:10:17.843
which leads me
to an important announcement.

01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:20.105
Just now,
at a worldwide summit

01:10:20.192 --> 01:10:21.955
leaders from
more than a hundred

01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:23.727
of the world's
top countries

01:10:23.814 --> 01:10:27.265
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

01:10:29.047 --> 01:10:30.625
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

01:10:30.712 --> 01:10:31.929
from all over
the planet

01:10:32.016 --> 01:10:33.516
on our boat,
the Everjust

01:10:33.603 --> 01:10:36.996
for a televised
signing ceremony at sea.

01:10:37.222 --> 01:10:41.146
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

01:10:44.378 --> 01:10:46.407
So good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

01:10:46.494 --> 01:10:48.397
Hey.
Hi, it's me, again.

01:10:48.699 --> 01:10:51.571
Um, there's, uh, something
I've always wanted to ask you.

01:10:51.658 --> 01:10:54.132
Yeah, how do you balance
the superhero stuff

01:10:54.219 --> 01:10:55.629
with the life stuff?

01:10:56.057 --> 01:10:58.352
I know I can handle
the superhero stuff.

01:11:00.999 --> 01:11:02.559
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh.

01:11:02.746 --> 01:11:04.492
Would you please
excuse me a moment?

01:11:04.579 --> 01:11:07.472
Oh. Yeah, okay, see you later!
Good talk!

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.437
Hey, Vi.
Hey.

01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:33.555
Where's Jack-Jack?

01:11:33.642 --> 01:11:35.265
E's taking him
for a little bit.

01:11:35.352 --> 01:11:37.491
Edna is babysitting?
Yeah.

01:11:37.578 --> 01:11:39.831
And you're okay with this?

01:11:39.918 --> 01:11:42.714
Yeah. I don't know why,
but yeah.

01:11:44.286 --> 01:11:47.084
I wanted to say
something to you.

01:11:47.992 --> 01:11:49.808
Sorry about Tony.

01:11:50.713 --> 01:11:53.384
I didn't think about Dicker
erasing his memory

01:11:53.471 --> 01:11:56.909
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice

01:11:57.019 --> 01:12:00.487
you never made.
It's not fair, I know.

01:12:00.978 --> 01:12:03.061
And then, I made it worse
at the restaurant

01:12:03.148 --> 01:12:04.474
by trying to

01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:06.230
Anyway. Anyway

01:12:06.596 --> 01:12:07.970
I'm sorry.

01:12:08.379 --> 01:12:09.610
I'm used to knowing

01:12:09.697 --> 01:12:11.690
what the right thing
to do is

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:14.776
but now,
I'm not sure anymore.

01:12:15.025 --> 01:12:17.284
I just wanna be

01:12:19.357 --> 01:12:20.987
a good dad.

01:12:24.622 --> 01:12:26.667
You're not good.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.425
You're super.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.754
Are superheroes allowed
to drink on duty?

01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:45.843
I'm definitely not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:47.735
I know
I should be up there

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:50.508
but I had to step away from
the grip and grins, you know?

01:12:50.595 --> 01:12:53.480
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

01:12:53.797 --> 01:12:55.392
What are you getting
away from?

01:12:55.479 --> 01:12:58.797
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

01:12:58.884 --> 01:13:01.196
But you love him,
you two are this company.

01:13:01.283 --> 01:13:02.452
Yin and yang.
Yeah,

01:13:02.539 --> 01:13:04.593
I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.737
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

01:13:08.882 --> 01:13:11.025
I never know
what people want.

01:13:11.142 --> 01:13:12.894
What do you think
they want?

01:13:13.278 --> 01:13:14.258
Ease.

01:13:14.345 --> 01:13:17.491
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

01:13:17.578 --> 01:13:20.641
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

01:13:20.728 --> 01:13:22.398
Yeah. Kind of
like this case.

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:23.723
What?
The Screenslaver?

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:25.556
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

01:13:25.643 --> 01:13:27.079
It was too easy.

01:13:27.166 --> 01:13:30.339
That was too easy?
Wow.

01:13:30.426 --> 01:13:32.186
Funny.
What?

01:13:32.273 --> 01:13:34.016
Look at that.

01:13:34.103 --> 01:13:38.022
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:39.345
What?

01:13:40.238 --> 01:13:42.557
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

01:13:42.644 --> 01:13:43.766
It is.
Then

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.843
how come
Screenslaver has it?

01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.532
Maybe he hacked it?

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:50.343
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that

01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:52.758
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.785
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

01:13:54.872 --> 01:13:56.380
He wanted to get caught?

01:13:56.467 --> 01:13:58.375
He wanted you
to win.

01:13:58.462 --> 01:14:00.838
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

01:14:00.925 --> 01:14:02.014
If he's smart enough
to conceive

01:14:02.101 --> 01:14:03.664
of technology like this

01:14:03.751 --> 01:14:06.414
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:08.353
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.828
So? Einstein was a patent clerk.

01:14:10.915 --> 01:14:13.257
Look, you won.
You got the guy who

01:14:13.344 --> 01:14:15.547
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

01:14:15.634 --> 01:14:16.943
to hypnotize someone

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:19.241
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

01:14:19.328 --> 01:14:23.276
But what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

01:14:25.483 --> 01:14:30.047
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy

01:14:30.134 --> 01:14:31.669
but he was controlled
by the screens

01:14:31.756 --> 01:14:33.202
built into his glasses

01:14:34.138 --> 01:14:35.780
You are good.

01:14:40.064 --> 01:14:41.472
Look, the robot!

01:14:41.559 --> 01:14:42.413
It's taking off.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.573
I'm not getting a reading yet.

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.167
Press "fire"?
Now!

01:14:48.052 --> 01:14:49.153
More power.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.499
Oh, I hope this works, Dad.

01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:55.061
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

01:14:55.198 --> 01:14:57.790
Seventeen hours.

01:14:57.877 --> 01:14:59.678
How do you feel?

01:15:00.268 --> 01:15:01.349
Super.

01:15:01.654 --> 01:15:04.257
You got it, Dad.
Hurray!

01:15:04.732 --> 01:15:06.886
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

01:15:06.973 --> 01:15:08.800
you watching
Jack-Jack for me, E.

01:15:08.887 --> 01:15:11.871
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

01:15:11.958 --> 01:15:13.684
Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

01:15:13.771 --> 01:15:15.073
My rates are far too high.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.199
Oh, uh

01:15:16.277 --> 01:15:18.734
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

01:15:18.821 --> 01:15:20.628
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

01:15:20.715 --> 01:15:22.132
We deserve each other.

01:15:22.596 --> 01:15:24.723
Your child is a polymorph.

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:27.410
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

01:15:27.497 --> 01:15:29.126
It is not unknown
for supers

01:15:29.213 --> 01:15:30.870
to have more than one
power when young

01:15:30.957 --> 01:15:33.633
but this little one has many.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.078
Yes, you have many powers.

01:15:50.256 --> 01:15:52.659
I understand
your lack of sleep

01:15:52.746 --> 01:15:54.200
and coherency, Robert.

01:15:54.287 --> 01:15:55.472
Babies can be anything,

01:15:55.559 --> 01:15:57.298
and your child
is no exception.

01:15:57.393 --> 01:16:00.209
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

01:16:00.296 --> 01:16:03.191
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

01:16:03.278 --> 01:16:05.825
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night

01:16:05.912 --> 01:16:08.708
making sure you look
fabulous in your many forms.

01:16:08.795 --> 01:16:11.090
What are you You're
putting him in the

01:16:11.177 --> 01:16:12.410
In the chamber, Robert.

01:16:12.497 --> 01:16:14.120
He is part
of the demonstration

01:16:14.207 --> 01:16:15.341
and will be fine.

01:16:15.428 --> 01:16:17.497
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

01:16:17.584 --> 01:16:18.964
who has
multiple powers

01:16:19.051 --> 01:16:21.624
and no control
over them, yes?

01:16:22.053 --> 01:16:23.864
Huh. That sums it up.

01:16:23.951 --> 01:16:25.238
I often work to music

01:16:25.325 --> 01:16:28.073
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.366
Specifically, Mozart.

01:16:30.599 --> 01:16:31.784
I blended Kevlar

01:16:31.871 --> 01:16:34.284
with carbyne for
durability under duress

01:16:34.371 --> 01:16:35.926
and cotton for comfort.

01:16:36.013 --> 01:16:39.337
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors

01:16:39.424 --> 01:16:42.200
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:45.472
Oh, Lord!
What What is he doing? What is he doing?

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:48.520
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

01:16:48.607 --> 01:16:50.925
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker

01:16:51.012 --> 01:16:52.980
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:54.723
Oh, no. Cookies.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:55.878
I gotta get cookies!

01:16:55.965 --> 01:16:57.581
You do not need cookies.

01:16:57.668 --> 01:16:59.176
As I learned quite painfully

01:16:59.254 --> 01:17:00.279
last night

01:17:00.357 --> 01:17:01.792
any solution involving cookies

01:17:01.879 --> 01:17:04.687
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

01:17:06.684 --> 01:17:08.125
"Combustion imminent"?

01:17:08.212 --> 01:17:09.458
What does that mean?

01:17:10.632 --> 01:17:12.029
It means fire, Robert,

01:17:12.116 --> 01:17:14.316
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

01:17:14.403 --> 01:17:17.042
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

01:17:17.129 --> 01:17:19.460
before he trips
the sprinkler system.

01:17:21.259 --> 01:17:22.948
The flame retardant

01:17:23.035 --> 01:17:25.141
is blackberry lavender,
darling.

01:17:25.228 --> 01:17:28.112
Effective, edible,
and delicious.

01:17:28.199 --> 01:17:31.591
Well, what do you know?
That is useful.

01:17:31.678 --> 01:17:34.392
Although, I have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations

01:17:34.479 --> 01:17:36.169
for a single night's work

01:17:36.256 --> 01:17:37.644
the suit
and device contain

01:17:37.731 --> 01:17:39.897
a few more features
we need to discuss.

01:17:39.984 --> 01:17:42.393
Thanks again, E,
for everything.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.128
How much
do I owe you for

01:17:44.215 --> 01:17:47.128
Pish-posh, darling.
Your bill will be covered by my fee

01:17:47.215 --> 01:17:49.222
for being Mr. Incredible,
Elasti Girl,

01:17:49.309 --> 01:17:51.880
and Frozone's
exclusive designer

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:54.198
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

01:17:54.285 --> 01:17:56.128
But babysitting this one

01:17:56.215 --> 01:17:59.562
I do for free, darling.

01:18:17.006 --> 01:18:19.503
I would
resist the temptation to stretch.

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:22.804
The temperature around you
is well below freezing.

01:18:22.896 --> 01:18:25.464
Try to stretch
and you'll break.

01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:28.007
So, you're
the Screenslaver.

01:18:28.094 --> 01:18:30.429
Yes and no.

01:18:30.631 --> 01:18:32.926
Let's say,
I created the character

01:18:33.013 --> 01:18:35.012
and pre-recorded
the messages.

01:18:35.099 --> 01:18:36.784
Does Winston know?

01:18:36.871 --> 01:18:39.438
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not.

01:18:39.525 --> 01:18:41.989
Can you imagine
what Mr. Free Enterprise

01:18:42.076 --> 01:18:43.926
would do
with my hypnosis technology?

01:18:44.013 --> 01:18:45.429
Worse than
what you're doing?

01:18:45.516 --> 01:18:47.528
Hey, I'm using
the technology

01:18:47.615 --> 01:18:49.738
to destroy
people's trust in it.

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.872
Like I'm using superheroes.

01:18:51.959 --> 01:18:53.606
Who did I put in jail?

01:18:53.693 --> 01:18:54.831
Pizza delivery guy.

01:18:54.918 --> 01:18:56.747
Seemed the right height,
build.

01:18:56.834 --> 01:18:58.691
He gave you
a pretty good fight.

01:18:58.778 --> 01:19:00.341
I should say I gave you

01:19:00.428 --> 01:19:02.324
a pretty good fight
through him.

01:19:02.411 --> 01:19:03.512
But it doesn't bother you

01:19:03.599 --> 01:19:05.261
that an innocent man
is in jail?

01:19:05.348 --> 01:19:08.544
Eh, he was surly
and the pizza was cold.

01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:10.267
I counted on you.

01:19:10.368 --> 01:19:11.769
That's why you failed.

01:19:11.856 --> 01:19:12.825
What?

01:19:12.912 --> 01:19:16.380
Why would you count on me?
Because I built you a bike?

01:19:16.467 --> 01:19:18.335
Because my brother
knows the words

01:19:18.422 --> 01:19:19.530
to your theme song?

01:19:19.617 --> 01:19:21.158
We don't know each other.

01:19:21.245 --> 01:19:23.073
But you can
count on me anyway.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.809
I am supposed to,
aren't I?

01:19:24.896 --> 01:19:27.058
Because you have
some strange abilities

01:19:27.145 --> 01:19:28.372
and a shiny costume

01:19:28.459 --> 01:19:30.683
the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives

01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:32.837
into your gloved hands.

01:19:32.924 --> 01:19:35.288
That's what
my father believed.

01:19:35.459 --> 01:19:37.458
When our home was broken into,

01:19:37.545 --> 01:19:39.073
my mother wanted to hide.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.714
Begged my father
to use the safe room.

01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:45.796
But Father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

01:19:46.107 --> 01:19:50.749
He died,
pointlessly, stupidly

01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:53.460
waiting for heroes
to save the day.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.747
But why would you

01:19:54.834 --> 01:19:57.023
Your brother
Is a child!

01:19:57.288 --> 01:19:58.618
He remembers the time

01:19:58.705 --> 01:20:01.245
when we had parents
and superheroes.

01:20:01.332 --> 01:20:04.966
So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.

01:20:05.053 --> 01:20:06.526
Mommy and Daddy went away

01:20:06.613 --> 01:20:08.763
because supers went away.

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:11.106
Our sweet parents
were fools

01:20:11.193 --> 01:20:13.323
to put their lives
in anybody else's hands.

01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:15.687
Superheroes keep us weak.

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.998
Are you gonna kill me?

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.803
Nah.

01:20:21.772 --> 01:20:23.242
Using you is better.

01:20:23.329 --> 01:20:26.577
You're gonna help me make
supers illegal

01:20:26.664 --> 01:20:28.035
forever.

01:20:32.783 --> 01:20:34.968
Dada. Dada.

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:37.616
Ready?
Laser eyes.

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:39.536
Stop.

01:20:39.623 --> 01:20:40.723
Wow!
Yeah!

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:42.081
Yay, Jack-Jack!
Yeah, baby!

01:20:42.168 --> 01:20:43.788
And that's not all.
Watch this.

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:45.851
Jack-Jack, blaster ready?

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:53.091
No way.
That is crazy cool.

01:20:53.169 --> 01:20:54.114
My turn.
I get to blast him first!

01:20:54.201 --> 01:20:55.909
Let me try. I want him. Give him to me.
Hey, I'm just demonstrating.

01:20:55.996 --> 01:20:58.964
No firing the baby around
the house, you understand?

01:20:59.051 --> 01:21:01.544
This is potentially
dangerous

01:21:01.631 --> 01:21:04.556
and we're trying to teach him
to control his powers, okay?

01:21:04.782 --> 01:21:06.746
Stop. See the screen.

01:21:08.246 --> 01:21:10.456
He vanished!
That's really cool!

01:21:10.543 --> 01:21:12.203
Okay, good. Use the thing.

01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:13.007
See that.

01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:15.412
That's the current readout.
Click it. See the readout?

01:21:15.499 --> 01:21:16.963
Dimension four.
See the shape?

01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:19.287
That's the room.
See where he is in relation?

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:20.669
So, where is he?

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:23.396
He's there!

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:26.685
Okay. Come out.
Num-num cookie?

01:21:27.856 --> 01:21:29.727
Yay, Jack-Jack!
Yeah, Jack-Jack!

01:21:29.814 --> 01:21:32.021
That's really cool.

01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:40.159
Hello?
Elasti Girl's in trouble.

01:21:40.246 --> 01:21:41.558
What? What happened to her?

01:21:41.645 --> 01:21:43.144
Sorry to tell you
on the phone.

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.702
Meet me on our ship
at DEVTECH.

01:21:44.789 --> 01:21:47.103
The ship at DEVTECH.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:49.306
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

01:21:49.393 --> 01:21:50.949
Lucius? Bob.
Helen's in trouble.

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:52.683
I need someone
to watch the kids.

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:54.212
Suit up. It might get weird.

01:21:54.299 --> 01:21:55.987
I'll be there.
ASAP. Fifteen tops.

01:21:56.074 --> 01:21:57.564
W here are you
going ASAP?

01:21:57.651 --> 01:21:59.192
You better be back ASAP!

01:21:59.279 --> 01:22:00.803
And leaving that suit.

01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:02.448
I gotta go.
I'll be home soon.

01:22:02.535 --> 01:22:03.712
Lucius will be here sooner.

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:05.872
No firing the baby
around the house, okay?

01:22:05.959 --> 01:22:07.671
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

01:22:07.758 --> 01:22:10.282
And why are you
in your Supersuit?

01:22:22.209 --> 01:22:23.826
Is that Mom's supersuit?

01:22:23.913 --> 01:22:25.668
She may need it.
You never know.

01:22:25.755 --> 01:22:27.192
What's going on?

01:22:27.279 --> 01:22:29.411
I don't know,
but Dad called Lucius

01:22:29.498 --> 01:22:31.426
after getting a call
about Mom

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.578
and then left.

01:22:32.665 --> 01:22:34.468
I thought you renounced
superheroes.

01:22:34.555 --> 01:22:37.578
Yeah, well,
I renounce my renunciation.

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.132
Put that on.

01:22:50.088 --> 01:22:52.843
Hello there, little fella.

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.106
Hello.

01:22:54.193 --> 01:22:55.606
You kids aren't safe.

01:22:55.693 --> 01:22:56.948
The Deavors sent us
to take you

01:22:57.035 --> 01:22:59.805
Well, isn't that redundant?

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:03.250
The Deavors just sent me here
to guard the house.

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:07.445
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

01:23:07.586 --> 01:23:09.686
I get it,
managerial screw up.

01:23:09.773 --> 01:23:11.229
Tell Winston
I handled it.

01:23:11.316 --> 01:23:12.738
You understand,
Ms

01:23:12.825 --> 01:23:13.899
Voyd.

01:23:14.145 --> 01:23:15.746
Ms. Voyd.

01:23:16.982 --> 01:23:18.077
Drive safely.

01:23:27.758 --> 01:23:31.815
The thing is, he wants us
to bring you, too.

01:23:31.902 --> 01:23:32.811
Hey.

01:23:34.498 --> 01:23:35.996
That isn't gonna
hold them long.

01:23:37.002 --> 01:23:38.656
Dash, grab the baby!

01:23:41.579 --> 01:23:42.735
Spread out!

01:23:44.775 --> 01:23:46.504
Whoa!
Oh!

01:23:46.591 --> 01:23:47.921
Dash!

01:23:48.184 --> 01:23:49.682
We gotta get to my car.

01:23:58.853 --> 01:24:01.257
What? What's going on?

01:24:01.344 --> 01:24:02.755
Little fella!

01:24:21.268 --> 01:24:22.557
It worked!

01:24:28.136 --> 01:24:30.255
Incredibile, windows down!

01:24:31.656 --> 01:24:32.657
Dive in!

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:41.838
Incredibile,
set voice identification.

01:24:41.925 --> 01:24:43.448
Loudly, say your names.

01:24:43.535 --> 01:24:46.547
Violet Parr.
Dashiell Robert Parr.

01:24:50.678 --> 01:24:51.843
Lucius!

01:24:51.943 --> 01:24:54.207
Incredibile, escape!

01:25:02.626 --> 01:25:03.634
Fill me in!

01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:05.443
Good news and bad news.
We found her.

01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:06.859
She seems physically fine

01:25:06.946 --> 01:25:08.704
but she's had an encounter
with Screenslaver

01:25:08.791 --> 01:25:11.405
and she's acting
kind of strange. In here.

01:25:14.552 --> 01:25:15.914
Strange how?

01:25:24.196 --> 01:25:25.625
Helen?

01:25:26.173 --> 01:25:27.970
Helen, what are you

01:25:36.377 --> 01:25:37.957
Helen, it's me.

01:25:54.868 --> 01:25:57.033
Incredibile, pull over.

01:26:01.377 --> 01:26:04.423
We can't go to E's.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:06.904
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius.

01:26:06.991 --> 01:26:08.671
They were
wearing them, too.

01:26:08.758 --> 01:26:11.459
They're all under
someone's control.

01:26:11.546 --> 01:26:14.145
They've probably done
the same to Mom.

01:26:15.692 --> 01:26:17.881
Okay. Bad guys after us.

01:26:17.968 --> 01:26:19.661
No Mom, no Dad.

01:26:19.748 --> 01:26:20.862
No Lucius.

01:26:20.949 --> 01:26:24.796
But we have our powers,
this car

01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:28.853
and what?

01:26:40.758 --> 01:26:43.756
Incredibile,
take us to DEVTECH.

01:26:46.995 --> 01:26:49.375
The kids have escaped
in a tricked out car,

01:26:49.462 --> 01:26:51.021
but we got Frozone.

01:26:51.108 --> 01:26:53.477
Bring him to the ship
at DEVTECH immediately.

01:26:58.858 --> 01:27:01.389
Aw, we missed 'em!

01:27:01.476 --> 01:27:05.938
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

01:27:08.329 --> 01:27:10.151
What did you do?
I don't know.

01:27:10.246 --> 01:27:13.224
What did you do?
I didn't do anything!

01:27:20.858 --> 01:27:24.157
Wow, this car does
anything I say.

01:27:31.735 --> 01:27:33.384
We didn't plan this well.

01:27:33.471 --> 01:27:34.929
What do you mean?
We're here, aren't we?

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:36.520
Yes, we're here.

01:27:36.607 --> 01:27:38.999
We need to be up there.

01:27:39.892 --> 01:27:41.056
Hey

01:27:41.408 --> 01:27:45.662
What if the Incredibile
has ejector seats?

01:27:45.749 --> 01:27:47.065
Wait, what? No.

01:27:47.152 --> 01:27:48.907
Yeah, baby!
No, don't say any more

01:27:48.994 --> 01:27:50.375
Max power! Launch!

01:27:57.935 --> 01:27:59.334
Come on.

01:28:02.184 --> 01:28:03.919
Hello!
Glad you could come.

01:28:04.006 --> 01:28:05.984
Welcome to the conference.
Good to see you.

01:28:16.314 --> 01:28:18.153
Our stars, where are they?

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.437
The event's about to start.

01:28:19.524 --> 01:28:21.472
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

01:28:21.559 --> 01:28:23.062
They'll join for the signing.

01:28:23.955 --> 01:28:26.477
Welcome, guests!
You're in for a treat.

01:28:26.564 --> 01:28:30.590
This ship is the largest
hydrofoil on the planet.

01:28:30.677 --> 01:28:32.464
So, hold onto something

01:28:32.551 --> 01:28:35.128
because we're going
to open her up!

01:28:53.218 --> 01:28:55.800
We need to find Mom and Dad.
Stay here.

01:28:55.887 --> 01:28:57.108
I'm gonna search for them.

01:28:57.195 --> 01:28:59.522
Wait! Who's gonna
watch Jack-Jack?

01:28:59.609 --> 01:29:01.449
Suck it up.
I won't be long.

01:29:01.925 --> 01:29:04.306
Wait. Wait, but, but wait!

01:29:04.393 --> 01:29:07.051
This is important.
They are in trouble.

01:29:07.138 --> 01:29:10.164
It's up to us.
To us, understand?

01:29:10.251 --> 01:29:13.426
Keep him amused but quiet!

01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:15.292
Ugh.

01:29:24.767 --> 01:29:26.897
Shh! Quiet!

01:29:27.851 --> 01:29:29.020
Huh?

01:29:33.279 --> 01:29:34.280
Jack-Jack?

01:29:44.102 --> 01:29:46.232
Jack-Jack?
Jack-Jack!

01:30:19.404 --> 01:30:20.423
Jack-Jack!

01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:22.193
The mesmerized supers
know we're here

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:25.163
but I found Mom and Dad
Where's Jack-Jack?

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:28.384
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

01:30:28.471 --> 01:30:30.176
The tracker.
Use the tracker.

01:30:33.985 --> 01:30:35.099
He's going up?

01:30:35.186 --> 01:30:37.450
He's in an elevator.
Let's go!

01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:41.979
Hey, little baby.
Where are your parents?

01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:46.569
And here they are, folks!

01:30:46.656 --> 01:30:49.374
The supers who started
this whole thing.

01:30:49.461 --> 01:30:51.700
I told you
they'd be there in time.

01:30:51.787 --> 01:30:53.985
Hey, did you make them
new masks?

01:30:54.072 --> 01:30:56.084
Yeah. Night vision,
et cetera

01:30:56.171 --> 01:30:57.194
They look good, right?

01:30:57.281 --> 01:30:59.061
So simple, even he can do it.

01:30:59.148 --> 01:31:03.155
And we're back live in
three, two, one

01:31:03.242 --> 01:31:04.884
This is
a momentous occasion.

01:31:04.971 --> 01:31:06.888
We've all managed
to accomplish

01:31:06.975 --> 01:31:10.270
something extraordinarily rare
in today's world.

01:31:10.357 --> 01:31:11.976
We agree on something.

01:31:14.854 --> 01:31:18.127
We agree to undo
a bad decision.

01:31:18.214 --> 01:31:21.321
To make sure a few extraordinarily
gifted members

01:31:21.408 --> 01:31:23.981
of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.

01:31:24.068 --> 01:31:27.122
To invite them once again
to use their gifts

01:31:27.209 --> 01:31:28.792
to benefit the world.

01:31:28.879 --> 01:31:30.053
I thank all of you

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:33.249
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

01:31:33.336 --> 01:31:35.615
With special thanks
to Ambassador Selick.

01:31:35.702 --> 01:31:37.450
Yeah, it's okay.
Let her hear you.

01:31:37.537 --> 01:31:38.928
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:31:39.015 --> 01:31:40.137
Thank you, Ambassador,

01:31:40.224 --> 01:31:42.459
for your early
and very crucial support.

01:31:42.546 --> 01:31:45.224
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you

01:31:45.311 --> 01:31:46.567
to be the first signature

01:31:46.654 --> 01:31:50.477
on the International
Superhero Accord.

01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:53.367
There it is!

01:32:07.111 --> 01:32:08.926
Holy cow!

01:32:09.013 --> 01:32:11.477
I know he's on fire.
Just put him out.

01:32:17.881 --> 01:32:19.978
They're coming.

01:32:28.936 --> 01:32:30.603
Is it okay
to give him that?

01:32:30.690 --> 01:32:33.305
I wasn't hearing
any better ideas.

01:32:57.728 --> 01:32:58.901
No!

01:32:59.464 --> 01:33:01.104
Come on, Jack-Jack.

01:33:01.191 --> 01:33:02.278
We have to go.

01:33:02.365 --> 01:33:03.921
Cookie num-num?

01:33:16.214 --> 01:33:19.070
Mama, Mama.
I see him. He's getting away!

01:33:19.157 --> 01:33:20.446
Stand back.

01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:26.738
Darn it!
He's heading for Mom.

01:33:28.605 --> 01:33:32.135
It is done.
The world is super again.

01:33:37.502 --> 01:33:40.191
Group photo. Come on.
Group photo, everyone.

01:33:40.278 --> 01:33:42.916
Squeeze in. That's it.
Historic occasion.

01:33:43.003 --> 01:33:44.459
Everyone, smile.

01:33:51.362 --> 01:33:53.051
Go on phase two.

01:33:53.138 --> 01:33:55.845
Years of mandated
hiding and silence

01:33:55.932 --> 01:33:57.168
have made us bitter.

01:33:57.255 --> 01:33:59.036
You bring us out
into the light

01:33:59.123 --> 01:34:00.594
only to clean up the messes

01:34:00.681 --> 01:34:02.513
your lack
of discipline creates.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.149
Your bodies
and your character are weak.

01:34:05.236 --> 01:34:08.819
Your promises are empty,
and you will pay for it.

01:34:08.906 --> 01:34:10.688
We no longer serve you.

01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:12.205
We serve only us.

01:34:12.292 --> 01:34:14.400
May the fittest survive.

01:34:16.525 --> 01:34:17.652
Well, we, um

01:34:18.198 --> 01:34:20.587
Some very alarming
moments there

01:34:20.674 --> 01:34:23.289
before the, uh,
technical difficulties.

01:34:23.448 --> 01:34:24.777
Please bear with us.

01:34:37.676 --> 01:34:38.919
What?

01:34:39.372 --> 01:34:40.863
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!

01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:41.934
Hold! Let him talk.

01:34:42.021 --> 01:34:44.034
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge.

01:34:44.121 --> 01:34:45.181
Repeat.
Now.

01:34:56.426 --> 01:34:58.120
A little further.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.346
Little further. Stop.

01:35:05.752 --> 01:35:08.305
What the A baby?

01:35:08.392 --> 01:35:10.523
Mom and Dad.
Uncle Lucius?

01:35:12.714 --> 01:35:14.543
My mama.
Jack-Jack, no!

01:35:17.635 --> 01:35:19.565
A super baby?

01:35:24.308 --> 01:35:25.656
No, no, no!

01:35:25.743 --> 01:35:26.839
Put him down!

01:35:28.546 --> 01:35:30.127
Grab her!
No!

01:35:30.214 --> 01:35:31.477
Hold Jack-Jack.

01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:41.016
No!

01:35:41.454 --> 01:35:43.307
Hey, it's me!

01:35:43.394 --> 01:35:45.060
Yeah, that's what
I thought last time.

01:35:45.147 --> 01:35:48.001
Kids, what are you Wha

01:35:49.144 --> 01:35:51.755
You came for us?

01:35:51.903 --> 01:35:52.974
Don't be mad.

01:35:53.061 --> 01:35:56.142
Oh, sweetie,
how could I be mad?

01:35:56.523 --> 01:35:57.899
I'm proud.

01:35:58.905 --> 01:36:00.638
Not to break up
a tender moment,

01:36:00.725 --> 01:36:02.226
but where are we?

01:36:02.313 --> 01:36:03.577
Is this DEVTECH's ship?

01:36:03.664 --> 01:36:05.544
Evelyn Deavor
controls the Screenslaver

01:36:05.631 --> 01:36:08.335
and until a second ago, us.

01:36:08.476 --> 01:36:10.553
Where's the crew?

01:36:10.655 --> 01:36:12.570
Collision detected.
Correct course.

01:36:12.657 --> 01:36:13.715
Uh-oh.
Did I do that?

01:36:13.802 --> 01:36:17.150
Mom, the suit?
Try this.

01:36:19.765 --> 01:36:22.330
Phase Three.
Go on Phase Three!

01:36:25.503 --> 01:36:27.929
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:28.882
I went to the house.

01:36:28.969 --> 01:36:30.661
You didn't escape?
How did you not escape?

01:36:30.748 --> 01:36:32.715
Hey!
We just saved you!

01:36:32.802 --> 01:36:34.560
Escape? Escape from who?

01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:39.087
Those guys!

01:36:41.552 --> 01:36:44.056
What the?
Jack-Jack has powers?

01:36:44.143 --> 01:36:46.372
We know.
Fight now, talk later.

01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:21.269
Jack-Jack.

01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:22.573
Laser eyes!

01:37:32.436 --> 01:37:33.550
Ah-ha!

01:37:44.348 --> 01:37:45.549
Ugh.

01:37:50.488 --> 01:37:52.273
Come with me, Winston.

01:37:52.523 --> 01:37:54.512
Did I faint?
You'll be safe here.

01:37:54.599 --> 01:37:56.589
Safe? Safe from what?

01:37:57.454 --> 01:37:59.638
Where are the diplomats?
The supers?

01:37:59.725 --> 01:38:00.846
Still hypnotized.

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:03.596
What have you done?

01:38:07.638 --> 01:38:09.647
Evelyn, she's escaping.

01:38:09.769 --> 01:38:12.081
Well, go after her.
Finish your mission.

01:38:12.168 --> 01:38:14.317
I can't just go!
What about the kids?

01:38:14.404 --> 01:38:16.811
Jack-Jack, who's gonna
Mom!

01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:19.343
Go. We've got this.

01:38:20.618 --> 01:38:22.237
Voyd, come with me.

01:38:22.324 --> 01:38:24.036
I'll go shut down
the engine.

01:38:24.123 --> 01:38:25.464
I'll try to slow the
ship from the bow.

01:38:25.551 --> 01:38:28.612
Wait, someone's missing.
Where's the crusher guy?

01:38:28.699 --> 01:38:30.489
Strap in now!

01:38:45.893 --> 01:38:47.506
It's for your own good.

01:38:47.711 --> 01:38:49.326
No!

01:38:49.413 --> 01:38:50.661
This is.

01:39:01.826 --> 01:39:04.556
We're too late.
Get me up to the jet.

01:39:28.419 --> 01:39:31.320
Hey, you did this.
Can you undo it?

01:39:31.407 --> 01:39:33.258
You want me to un-crush?

01:39:33.345 --> 01:39:35.146
What?
No one's ever asked for that?

01:39:35.233 --> 01:39:38.133
No. To un-crush is silly.
Why un-crush?

01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:39.961
To get into the engine room.

01:39:40.048 --> 01:39:41.420
Oh, forget it.
We don't have enough time.

01:39:41.507 --> 01:39:43.554
What if I said
to un-punch someone?

01:39:43.641 --> 01:39:44.797
What do you do?

01:39:48.251 --> 01:39:50.132
Welcome aboard, Elasti Girl.

01:39:50.219 --> 01:39:51.506
Although
we haven't yet reached

01:39:51.593 --> 01:39:53.322
our cruising altitude

01:39:54.389 --> 01:39:56.913
feel free to roam about
the cabin.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.459
Or just relax

01:39:58.546 --> 01:40:02.143
and let the cabin roam
about you.

01:40:11.385 --> 01:40:13.476
I can't get
to the engine room!

01:40:13.563 --> 01:40:14.813
We gotta do something!

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:16.482
Because trying to
slow it down ain't working.

01:40:16.569 --> 01:40:18.415
Hey! What about
turning the boat?

01:40:18.502 --> 01:40:19.842
The steering's been destroyed!

01:40:19.929 --> 01:40:22.070
Dash means from the outside!
Yeah!

01:40:22.157 --> 01:40:23.521
If we break off
one of the foils

01:40:23.608 --> 01:40:24.680
and turn the rudder

01:40:24.767 --> 01:40:26.709
we can veer the ship
away from the city!

01:40:26.796 --> 01:40:27.836
That might work.

01:40:27.923 --> 01:40:29.709
I'll turn the front,
you turn the rear.

01:40:29.796 --> 01:40:32.000
Using the rudder?
That's underwater.

01:40:32.087 --> 01:40:33.138
How am I supposed to get

01:40:33.225 --> 01:40:35.040
All right.
Come on, kids.

01:40:35.127 --> 01:40:38.054
Dad, I know
this is going to work.

01:40:38.141 --> 01:40:40.695
But if it doesn't,
and we crash

01:40:40.782 --> 01:40:44.111
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

01:40:44.290 --> 01:40:47.986
I should stay here.
With Jack-Jack.

01:40:48.199 --> 01:40:49.499
That's my girl.

01:40:49.586 --> 01:40:52.525
Remember, Bob,
we're both turning right!

01:40:58.988 --> 01:41:01.085
You know what's sad?

01:41:04.251 --> 01:41:06.004
If it weren't
for your core beliefs

01:41:06.091 --> 01:41:08.814
I think we could have
been good friends.

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.784
At least

01:41:12.623 --> 01:41:14.753
I have core beliefs.

01:41:15.984 --> 01:41:17.377
We have breaking news

01:41:17.464 --> 01:41:19.610
While there is
still no radio contact,

01:41:19.697 --> 01:41:21.066
the ship
has changed direction

01:41:21.153 --> 01:41:22.324
and is heading towards land

01:41:22.411 --> 01:41:24.109
at a high rate of speed.

01:41:28.173 --> 01:41:29.802
So, Dash

01:41:30.841 --> 01:41:32.330
I am going to the rudder.

01:41:32.417 --> 01:41:35.525
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

01:41:35.612 --> 01:41:37.601
Okay, Dad.
Now lower me down

01:41:41.524 --> 01:41:44.921
The reputations of
superheroes are ruined.

01:41:45.021 --> 01:41:48.600
You will never
become legal. Ever.

01:41:48.827 --> 01:41:49.966
Never?

01:41:50.053 --> 01:41:51.713
No.

01:41:51.847 --> 01:41:53.595
Ever?
No.

01:41:53.682 --> 01:41:56.912
Not even a little
smidgee widgee?

01:41:56.999 --> 01:41:58.515
Oh, hypoxia.

01:41:58.602 --> 01:42:00.258
When you don't have
enough oxygen,

01:42:00.345 --> 01:42:02.701
things seem really silly.

01:42:08.494 --> 01:42:10.913
Things get sillier

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.761
and sillier
and then you die.

01:42:12.848 --> 01:42:15.006
I don't wanna die.

01:42:15.093 --> 01:42:17.623
Ah, nobody does.

01:42:17.710 --> 01:42:18.708
Really.

01:42:18.795 --> 01:42:21.421
Not such a bad way to go.

01:42:39.585 --> 01:42:42.100
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

01:42:42.187 --> 01:42:44.910
All supers,
protect your ambassadors!

01:42:45.649 --> 01:42:47.100
Follow.

01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:51.986
Dad's been underwater
for too long.

01:43:00.231 --> 01:43:01.800
We gotta pull him up.

01:43:01.887 --> 01:43:03.747
Wait. It's too soon.

01:43:17.223 --> 01:43:20.161
I'm gonna press the button!
Not yet!

01:43:34.677 --> 01:43:36.966
It's turning. It's working.

01:43:40.405 --> 01:43:43.255
Now!
Dash, now!

01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:47.207
Save yourself. Make a chute.

01:43:49.414 --> 01:43:51.469
Make a chute. Make a chute.

01:43:51.556 --> 01:43:52.897
Make a chute!

01:43:55.293 --> 01:43:57.317
Helen! Brace yourselves!

01:44:05.363 --> 01:44:07.193
Crash positions!

01:44:25.486 --> 01:44:26.527
Whoo.

01:44:27.107 --> 01:44:31.204
I missed Jack-Jack's first power?

01:44:31.291 --> 01:44:33.703
Actually, you missed
the first 17.

01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:35.413
Oh!

01:44:47.346 --> 01:44:51.035
The fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right.

01:44:51.253 --> 01:44:53.469
But it does make you alive.

01:44:53.556 --> 01:44:55.261
And I'm grateful
for that.

01:44:55.487 --> 01:44:58.364
I'm sorry,
but she'll go to prison.

01:44:58.451 --> 01:44:59.884
Well, I'm sorry she's rich

01:44:59.971 --> 01:45:02.350
and will probably get no more
than a slap on the wrist.

01:45:02.437 --> 01:45:05.353
First of all, Violet,
I like you.

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.343
And who knows what the
future may bring

01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:11.943
but I have a good feeling
about all of you.

01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:13.411
Hmm. Good feeling.

01:45:13.498 --> 01:45:15.163
Should we be worried?

01:45:15.250 --> 01:45:17.949
You guys got the next shift.
I'm beat. Oh!

01:45:18.036 --> 01:45:20.101
I saw what you did back there.
That was incredible!

01:45:20.188 --> 01:45:21.306
No pun intended.

01:45:21.393 --> 01:45:23.070
Sorry I had to punch you.

01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:27.847
Yeah, baby! My sweet ride!

01:45:40.510 --> 01:45:43.773
And in recognition
of the extraordinary service

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.083
they have demonstrated

01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:47.552
the legal status
of superheroes

01:45:47.639 --> 01:45:49.959
is hereby restored.

01:45:58.646 --> 01:46:00.659
You don't know me,
do you?

01:46:00.746 --> 01:46:02.060
No, I don't

01:46:02.147 --> 01:46:03.423
Wait.

01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:04.759
Are you the girl

01:46:04.846 --> 01:46:07.206
with the water?
I'm Violet Parr.

01:46:07.986 --> 01:46:09.797
I'm Tony.
Okay.

01:46:09.884 --> 01:46:12.542
You split up into separate
groups and stuff

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.862
Tony, this is my mom.
Pleased to meet you.

01:46:22.949 --> 01:46:24.923
This is my dad.
Oh, we've met.

01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:27.029
And this is embarrassing.

01:46:27.116 --> 01:46:28.395
Charmed, I'm sure.

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:30.274
My little brother, Dash.

01:46:30.361 --> 01:46:32.743
And the baby is Jack-Jack.

01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:36.042
I tried to limit it
to one parent.

01:46:36.129 --> 01:46:38.538
We're all going to a movie,
too, Tony. Don't mind us.

01:46:38.625 --> 01:46:40.923
We'll be sitting on the
other side of the theater.

01:46:41.010 --> 01:46:42.235
Not watching you.

01:46:42.322 --> 01:46:44.518
He's kidding.

01:46:44.605 --> 01:46:47.612
They are only dropping
us off at the theater.

01:46:47.699 --> 01:46:50.440
They have
other things to do.

01:46:50.527 --> 01:46:52.977
So, you guys are close,
I guess.

01:46:53.064 --> 01:46:55.353
Yeah, I guess.
We can get closer.

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.842
Bob.

01:47:11.253 --> 01:47:12.762
Stop! Let us out!

01:47:12.886 --> 01:47:14.502
Here, large popcorn,
small soda.

01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:16.801
Save me a seat, center,
about eight rows back.

01:47:16.911 --> 01:47:20.403
I'll be back before
the previews are over.

01:53:28.459 --> 01:53:31.403
Here comes Elasti Girl

01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:34.719
Stretching her arms
Elasti Girl

01:53:34.806 --> 01:53:39.372
No one's beyond her reach

01:53:39.459 --> 01:53:43.233
Elasti Girl

01:53:46.844 --> 01:53:51.804
Ah, Elasti Girl

01:53:53.513 --> 01:53:56.382
Here comes Elasti Girl

01:53:56.505 --> 01:53:59.784
Stretching her arms
Elasti Girl

01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:03.667
No one's beyond her reach

01:54:03.754 --> 01:54:11.398
Ah, Elasti Girl

01:54:16.674 --> 01:54:20.604
Who's the cat
who's always chill

01:54:20.717 --> 01:54:25.507
When survival odds
are close to nil?

01:54:25.857 --> 01:54:29.849
Frozone

01:54:31.670 --> 01:54:35.085
Frozone

01:54:35.359 --> 01:54:38.171
Always chill
Always chill

01:54:39.451 --> 01:54:41.086
Frozone

01:54:41.173 --> 01:54:42.899
Ah

01:54:42.986 --> 01:54:45.549
Frozone

01:54:45.636 --> 01:54:47.919
So chill
So chill

01:54:48.006 --> 01:54:49.542
Talk about Frozone

01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:53.006
Frozone

01:54:57.048 --> 01:54:58.711
Frozone

01:55:08.170 --> 01:55:10.507
Mr. Incredible

01:55:10.594 --> 01:55:13.684
Incredible

01:55:13.771 --> 01:55:17.830
Catching the bad guys
Pow, pow, pow

01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:26.523
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

01:55:34.085 --> 01:55:36.239
Mr. Incredible

01:55:36.326 --> 01:55:39.570
Incredible

01:55:39.657 --> 01:55:41.292
Punching the bad guys

01:55:41.379 --> 01:55:46.116
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
