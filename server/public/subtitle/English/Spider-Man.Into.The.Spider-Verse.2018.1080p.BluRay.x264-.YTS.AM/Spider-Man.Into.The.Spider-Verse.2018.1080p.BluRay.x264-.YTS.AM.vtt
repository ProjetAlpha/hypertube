WEBVTT

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.554
All right, let's
do this one last time.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:23.757
My name is Peter Parker.

00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:26.718
I was bitten
by a radioactive spider.

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:28.695
And for 10 years

00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:31.273
I've been the one
and only.

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.076
Spider-Man.

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.850
I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.953
With great power comes
great responsibility.

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:42.647
I saved a bunch of people,
fell in love, saved the city.

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:45.138
And then
I saved the city again.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:46.282
And again and again

00:01:46.368 --> 00:01:47.584
and again.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.085
And I did, uh

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.171
I did this.

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:52.639
Get on up
Get yourself together

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:53.835
Drive that funky soul

00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:55.796
We don't really talk
about this.

00:01:56.078 --> 00:01:58.546
Look, I'm a comic book.
I'm a cereal.

00:01:58.632 --> 00:01:59.804
Did a Christmas album.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.749
I have an excellent
theme song.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:03.202
Spider-man
Spider-man

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:05.647
And a so-so Popsicle.

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.936
I mean, I've looked worse.

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:09.507
But after everything

00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:13.397
I still love
being Spider-Man.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.694
I mean, who wouldn't?

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:17.201
So no matter
how many hits I take

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:22.537
I always find a way
to come back.

00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.890
Because the only thing standing
between this city and oblivion

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.444
is me.

00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:31.179
There's only one Spider-Man.

00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:33.694
And you're lookin' at him.

00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:37.357
Ooh

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:40.570
Ooh, ooh, ooh

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:45.342
Needless to say

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:50.772
Nevertheless
Callin' it quits

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.415
Now, baby, I'm a wreck
Miles!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.651
Miles, papá, time for school!

00:02:55.858 --> 00:02:57.471
Miles!

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.342
Miles!

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:02.710
Miles!
Yeah! Yeah?

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:04.927
Are you finished
packing for school?

00:03:05.012 --> 00:03:06.671
Yeah.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:10.155
Just ironing my last shirt.

00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.983
Speaks Spanish

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.577
You're a sunflower

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.265
Come on! You a grown man now.

00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:17.538
Let's show these teachers that.
Miles!

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.694
Where's my laptop?
Speaks Spanish

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.116
If you want me to drive you,

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:23.522
we gotta go now.
No, Dad. No, no, no, I-I'll walk.

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:25.305
Personal chauffeur going once.
It's okay.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.843
Speaks Spanish

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.257
Miles! Gotta go.
In a minute!

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:31.101
Gotta go.
In a minute!

00:03:31.193 --> 00:03:32.420
Mom, I gotta go.

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:33.804
In a minute.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.993
Speaks Spanish

00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:40.315
See you Friday.
Okay, mummy.

00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:41.666
Speaks Spanish

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.952
Wow! Look who's back.
Yo, what's going on, bro?

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:47.671
Hey, I'm just walking by.
How you doin'?

00:03:47.757 --> 00:03:49.679
Speaks Spanish

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:52.022
Yo, Miles! You feel
that earthquake last night?

00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:54.877
What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:56.154
How's that new school?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.718
So easy.
We miss you, Miles.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:00.048
You miss me?
I still live here!

00:04:00.202 --> 00:04:02.132
Wait, you miss me?

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.105
Man Singing in Spanish

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.200
Contra!

00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:14.343
Oh, come on.

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:18.514
Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.887
You can walk plenty
on Saturday

00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:20.869
when you peel
those stickers off.

00:04:20.954 --> 00:04:22.888
You saw that?
I don't know if that was me, dad.

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:25.061
And the two from yesterday
on Clinton.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.653
Yeah, those were me.

00:04:27.922 --> 00:04:30.874
So, oh, look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:32.561
You see the mass?
Totally. Yeah.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.576
You see that. What's that one called?
Foam Party.

00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.524
"Foam Party"? Come on.
Mmm.

00:04:37.624 --> 00:04:39.918
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that mass?

00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:42.578
I see it.
Is that a coffee shop or a disco?

00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:44.092
Dad, you're old, man.

00:04:44.178 --> 00:04:45.088
There are multiple reports

00:04:45.173 --> 00:04:47.290
of another mysterious
seismic event last night.

00:04:47.376 --> 00:04:49.918
Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.

00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:53.126
Spider-Man. I mean,
this guy swings in once a day,

00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:55.700
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

00:04:55.786 --> 00:04:56.731
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:58.387
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

00:04:58.473 --> 00:05:00.438
lives on the line, no masks.
Uh-huh.

00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:02.416
You know, we show our faces
I know. Dad, dad.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.744
Speed up. Speed up.
I know these kids.

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:05.869
You know, with great ability
comes great accountability.

00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:07.220
That's not even
how the saying goes,

00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:08.345
dad.
I do like his cereal, though.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.524
I'll give him that.

00:05:09.622 --> 00:05:11.880
Oh, my gosh.
Don't cops run red lights?

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:12.983
Oh, yeah, some do.

00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:14.892
But not your dad.

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:18.156
My memories keep begging

00:05:18.321 --> 00:05:20.224
For someone else

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:25.560
I know this feeling, yes
I know it very well

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:27.849
Why can't I go back
to Brooklyn Middle?

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:29.471
You've given it
two weeks.

00:05:29.557 --> 00:05:30.803
We're not having
this conversation.

00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:33.373
I just think that
this new school is elitist.

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:34.443
"Elitist"?
And I would prefer to be

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.537
at a normal school
among the people.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.540
"The people"?
These are your people.

00:05:38.626 --> 00:05:40.735
I'm only here 'cause
I won that stupid lottery.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:43.688
No way. You passed the entry
test just like everybody else. Okay.

00:05:43.774 --> 00:05:46.571
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that? Huh?

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:47.946
You wanna end up
like your uncle?

00:05:48.032 --> 00:05:50.001
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:52.516
We all make choices in life.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:53.731
It doesn't feel
like I have

00:05:53.817 --> 00:05:55.231
a choice right now.
You don't!

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.180
I love you, Miles.

00:06:10.298 --> 00:06:12.876
Yeah, I know, Dad.
See you Friday.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.782
You gotta say "I love you" back.
Dad, are you serious?

00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:22.579
I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad."
You wanna hear me say it?

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.392
You're dropping me off at a school.
"I love you, Dad."

00:06:24.477 --> 00:06:26.282
Look at this place.
"Dad, I love you."

00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:30.985
Dad, I love you.

00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:32.468
That's a copy.

00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:34.756
Tie your shoes, please.

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:38.800
"I love you, Dad."

00:06:40.118 --> 00:06:42.555
Hey, good morning.
How you doin'?

00:06:42.743 --> 00:06:45.055
Weekend was short, huh?
"That's a copy."

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.587
Oh, my gosh! This is Th
This is embarrassing.

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:49.243
We wore
the same jacket.

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.762
Hey. Your shoe's untied.
Yeah,

00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:53.914
Yeah, I'm aware.
It's a choice.

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:56.884
Theory is that
All matter is composed

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.790
Of at least three

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.129
Fundamental particles

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.916
Who can solve this for XY?

00:07:04.322 --> 00:07:05.799
And that is known
as a syllogism.

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:08.237
Read two chapters
of Great Expectations.

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:11.048
A take-home quiz
on volumetric pressure.

00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:13.141
Five-page essay
with your conclusions stressed.

00:07:21.704 --> 00:07:23.604
countless other possibilities.

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:26.430
There could be a universe
where I am wearing red.

00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:28.274
Or wearing leather pants.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.305
Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark.
You're late again.

00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:34.673
Einstein said
time was relative, right?

00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:38.539
Maybe I'm not late.
Maybe you guys are early.

00:07:42.297 --> 00:07:45.266
Sorry.
It was just so quiet.

00:07:45.352 --> 00:07:47.540
Would you like
to keep standing there,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.501
or do you wanna sit down?

00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:54.344
Our universe is, in fact,
one of many parallel universes

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.407
happening
at the exact same time.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.016
Thanks to everyone here at
the Fisk Family Foundation

00:07:59.102 --> 00:08:01.122
I liked your joke.
Really?

00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:04.516
I mean, it wasn't funny.
That's why I laughed.

00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:06.884
But it was smart,
so I liked it.

00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:09.818
I don't know. I don't think
I've seen you before. -

00:08:09.904 --> 00:08:11.588
Every choice that we make

00:08:11.673 --> 00:08:14.963
would create countless
other possibilities.

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:18.243
A what-if to infinity.

00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:21.287
A zero?
A few more of those,

00:08:21.373 --> 00:08:23.935
you'd probably have
to kick me outta here, huh?

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:26.506
Maybe I'm just not right
for this school.

00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:29.193
If a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:31.068
on a true-or-false quiz
at random,

00:08:31.154 --> 00:08:32.855
do you know
what score they would get?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.756
50%?
That's right!

00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:36.891
The only way to get
all the answers wrong

00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:39.244
is to know
which answers are right.

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:41.829
You're trying to quit.

00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:44.300
And I'm not gonna let you.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:47.603
I'm
assigning you a personal essay.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.458
Not about physics,
but about you,

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:53.197
and what kind of person
you want to be.

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:08.511
Unh. Unh
Unh. Unh

00:09:09.161 --> 00:09:10.310
Come on

00:09:10.396 --> 00:09:12.198
Ha, sicker than
Your average

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:14.169
Poppa twist cabbage
Off instinct

00:09:14.381 --> 00:09:15.365
Don't think

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:20.223
My Detroit players, timbs for
My hooligans in Brooklyn

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:23.622
Dead right, if the head
Right, Biggie there e'rynight

00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:28.239
Never lose, never choose to
Bruise crews who

00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:29.886
Do something to us
Come on

00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:32.731
Uncle Aaron!
Hey! Were you scared?

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.521
You want that?

00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:40.564
What's up with school?

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:42.708
Going great!
Got tons of friends.

00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:44.923
You can't tell me
it's all that bad there.

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:46.435
Smart girls
is where it's at.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.990
Place must be full of 'em.

00:09:50.434 --> 00:09:51.508
No, there's no one.

00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:53.287
Yo, I can't have no nephew of mine.
No one.

00:09:53.372 --> 00:09:54.546
On the streets with no game.
Hey,

00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.669
I got game.
There's a new girl.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:59.091
Actually, you know,
she's kinda into me.

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.865
You know how it is.

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:02.662
What's her name?

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:04.232
You know,

00:10:04.318 --> 00:10:05.741
we layin' down the
groundwork right now.

00:10:05.826 --> 00:10:08.591
You know about
the shoulder touch?

00:10:08.677 --> 00:10:10.154
'Course I do.

00:10:10.864 --> 00:10:12.296
But tell me anyway.

00:10:12.382 --> 00:10:16.300
Tomorrow, find that girl.
You walk up to her and be like:

00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:20.038
"Hey."

00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:21.405
You serious, Uncle Aaron?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.408
I'm tellin' you, man,
it's science.

00:10:23.493 --> 00:10:26.277
So walk up to her
and be like: "Hey."

00:10:26.362 --> 00:10:29.379
No, no, no, no.
Like: "Hey."

00:10:29.465 --> 00:10:30.639
"Hey."

00:10:30.725 --> 00:10:33.283
No. "Hey."

00:10:33.368 --> 00:10:34.573
"Hey."

00:10:36.037 --> 00:10:38.521
You sure you my nephew, man?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.216
Is that her?

00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:43.534
I should probably go.
Still got a paper to do tonight.

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:47.130
Yo, you been holdin' out on me?
You throw these up yet?

00:10:47.215 --> 00:10:50.134
Naw, man. You know
my dad. I can't.

00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:52.336
Come on. I got a spot
you ain't gon' believe.

00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:54.401
Naw, I can't.
I can't. Can't.

00:10:56.534 --> 00:10:58.034
I'm gonna get
in so much trouble.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.939
Hey, man. Tell him
your art teacher made you.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.243
Hey! How'd you know
about this place?

00:11:04.406 --> 00:11:06.472
Did an engineering
job down here.

00:11:08.825 --> 00:11:11.262
One, two, three
Four, five

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:23.848
What's up?

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.862
Yeah, man,
I knew we were related.

00:11:27.357 --> 00:11:28.675
Whoa!

00:11:29.566 --> 00:11:31.768
Brooklyn!

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:36.682
There's a lot of
history on these walls.

00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:40.057
This is so fresh.

00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:49.714
And now
you on your own, Miles.

00:11:51.413 --> 00:11:53.120
Whoa, slow down a little.

00:11:54.034 --> 00:11:55.276
That's better.

00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:58.409
Who's the black sheep?
What's the black sheep?

00:11:58.495 --> 00:12:00.901
Don't know who I am
When I'm coming so you sleep

00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:03.372
See what you got now?
Makin' mistakes is part of it.

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:05.245
And you can't beat that

00:12:09.874 --> 00:12:11.670
The real Miles
comin' outta hidin'.

00:12:11.756 --> 00:12:13.770
You gotta hay?
It's for the hoes

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:16.614
Now you can cut that line
with another color.

00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:18.866
You can get with this
Or you can get with that

00:12:18.952 --> 00:12:21.270
You can get with this or
You can get with that

00:12:21.356 --> 00:12:23.374
You can get with this
Or you can get with that

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.595
I think you'll get with this
For this is where it's at

00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:28.466
Little help?

00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:31.379
who was quite contrary
Talkin' 'bout Mary

00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:33.216
Did you want drips?
'Cause if you do, that's cool,

00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:34.880
but if you don't,
you gotta keep it moving.

00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:36.543
That's intentional.

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:44.421
Wow.
Is it too crazy?

00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:45.984
No, man.

00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:49.002
Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing there.

00:12:49.298 --> 00:12:50.753
Yeah.

00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:53.365
You know, me and your dad used
to do this back in the day.

00:12:53.549 --> 00:12:55.526
Stop lyin'.
It's true.

00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:59.163
Then he took on the cop thing,
and I don't know

00:12:59.494 --> 00:13:01.635
He's a good guy, just

00:13:02.076 --> 00:13:03.650
You know
what I'm sayin'.

00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:10.906
All right, come on, man.
I gotta roll.

00:13:36.819 --> 00:13:38.789
Miles, let's go.

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:09.936
That's weird.

00:14:10.022 --> 00:14:11.921
My pants shrank.

00:14:12.366 --> 00:14:13.803
I think I hit puberty.

00:14:21.663 --> 00:14:23.447
I gotta get new pants.

00:14:23.532 --> 00:14:26.350
Wait. Why is the voice
in my head so loud?

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:27.663
What?

00:14:28.018 --> 00:14:30.780
Oh! Are you okay?
What?

00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:32.991
Why am I so sweaty?

00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:34.635
Why are you so sweaty?

00:14:34.882 --> 00:14:36.717
It's a puberty thing.

00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:40.147
I don't know why I said that.
I'm not going through puberty.

00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:43.405
I did,
but I'm done.

00:14:43.652 --> 00:14:45.663
I'm a man.

00:14:46.048 --> 00:14:49.466
So you're, like, new
here, right? We got that in common.

00:14:49.552 --> 00:14:51.311
Yeah. That's one thing.

00:14:51.426 --> 00:14:53.725
Cool. Yeah.
I'm Miles.

00:14:53.921 --> 00:14:56.757
I'm Gwe anda.

00:14:56.843 --> 00:14:58.527
Wait, your name is Gwanda?

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.030
Yes, it's African.
I'm South African.

00:15:02.116 --> 00:15:05.428
No accent though
'cause I was raised here.

00:15:05.514 --> 00:15:08.686
Do the shoulder
touch now before she walks away.

00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:14.224
Why is this so scary?

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.905
Am I doing this in slow motion
or does it just feel that way?

00:15:18.216 --> 00:15:22.716
I'm kidding. It's Wanda.
No "G." That's crazy. Heh.

00:15:24.654 --> 00:15:26.216
Hey.

00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:28.912
Okay, then.
Uh

00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:30.310
I'll see you around.

00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:32.552
Oh. See you.

00:15:33.302 --> 00:15:35.341
Sorry. Um
Hey.

00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:39.221
Oh, crap.
Can you let go, please?

00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:42.287
I can't let go.
Ow! Ow! Calm down. It's fine. Just

00:15:44.412 --> 00:15:46.197
Miles, let go.
Workin' on it.

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:47.932
It's just puberty.

00:15:48.017 --> 00:15:51.651
I don't think you know
what puberty is. Just relax.

00:15:51.737 --> 00:15:52.793
Okay, I have a plan.
Great.

00:15:52.878 --> 00:15:56.339
I'm gonna pull really hard.
That's a terrible plan.

00:15:56.426 --> 00:15:57.598
One.
Don't do this.

00:15:57.692 --> 00:15:58.775
Two.
Three!

00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:07.197
Nice to meet you?

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.382
Sure. Total pleasure.

00:16:15.911 --> 00:16:18.349
No one saw. It's okay.

00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:21.552
No one knows, no one knows.

00:16:24.073 --> 00:16:25.642
Everyone knows.

00:16:27.282 --> 00:16:29.365
Everyone knows.
They're talkin' 'bout me.

00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:32.146
They saw everything!
He knows. She knows. They know.

00:16:32.295 --> 00:16:33.644
Wow, she's super tall.

00:16:33.729 --> 00:16:35.560
Why is he smiling?
Am I the weird guy now?

00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:36.786
What am I doing?

00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:37.914
That guy's
such a weirdo.

00:16:38.006 --> 00:16:39.656
How do I stop?

00:16:39.841 --> 00:16:41.271
Can they hear my thoughts?!

00:16:41.357 --> 00:16:44.075
Why are all my thoughts
so loud?!

00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:46.922
Hey! I know you snuck out
last night, Morales.

00:16:47.008 --> 00:16:48.333
Play dumb!

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:49.717
Who's Morales?

00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:51.474
Not that dumb!

00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:53.296
Hey!

00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:01.905
Okay, okay. You're okay.

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:03.506
You're okay.

00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:05.375
He'll never find you.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.711
No.

00:17:11.592 --> 00:17:13.409
Ow!

00:17:13.517 --> 00:17:15.904
What are you doing
in my office, Morales?!

00:17:16.052 --> 00:17:18.689
Morales! Open up!

00:17:18.774 --> 00:17:20.423
Oh, Spider-bells
Goblin smells

00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:22.727
Why is this happening?

00:17:22.812 --> 00:17:24.326
Spider-buggy bleiw a tire

00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.404
He's got
a nice voice.

00:17:26.497 --> 00:17:28.215
Spidey-bells, Spidey-bells

00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:29.747
Open up!

00:17:30.903 --> 00:17:32.605
Stop sticking!

00:17:35.725 --> 00:17:37.741
Keep sticking, Miles! Oh!

00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:49.359
Hofstadter
is suggesting

00:17:50.672 --> 00:17:52.210
is that we

00:17:53.075 --> 00:17:54.424
look on the

00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:01.578
Okay.

00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:07.424
My room!

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.911
"Why is this happening?"

00:18:15.765 --> 00:18:17.455
"Please stop sticking."

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.502
"Please keep st"

00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:21.818
Wait, wait, wait.

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:23.323
How could there be
two Spider-Men?

00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:25.312
There can't be two Spider-Men.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.252
Can there?

00:18:30.558 --> 00:18:33.565
Come on, Uncle
Aaron, pick up. Pick up!

00:18:33.651 --> 00:18:35.432
Yo, it's Aaron.

00:18:35.517 --> 00:18:36.994
I'm outta town for a few days.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.494
I'll hit you when I'm back. Peace.
No. No-No-No-No-No.

00:18:39.627 --> 00:18:41.073
It's not possible!

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:43.468
It's It's just puberty.

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.366
It's a normal spider
and I'm a normal kid!

00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:50.934
All right!

00:18:55.275 --> 00:18:56.869
I gotta tell someone.

00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:24.439
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.

00:19:27.469 --> 00:19:29.052
Find the spider.

00:19:29.138 --> 00:19:30.635
You'll see.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.871
It's a normal spider.

00:19:46.956 --> 00:19:52.076
It's, like, boring
how normal this spider is.

00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:02.819
I'm right here.

00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:05.564
Why is this happening to me?

00:20:11.247 --> 00:20:14.213
Slow down! What am I doing?

00:20:19.752 --> 00:20:20.919
Way over there.

00:20:21.023 --> 00:20:22.134
You're like me.

00:20:22.314 --> 00:20:23.430
Miles. Look out.

00:20:23.516 --> 00:20:24.969
I don't wanna be a hero.

00:20:25.055 --> 00:20:26.540
Miles.

00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:29.783
Whoa!

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:35.299
Norman, listen to me.

00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:37.192
Spider-Man?

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:40.371
I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.

00:20:40.587 --> 00:20:42.923
Brooklyn is not zoned
for that.

00:20:44.012 --> 00:20:45.877
It's not up to me.

00:20:45.963 --> 00:20:47.306
Is that Green Goblin?!

00:20:47.392 --> 00:20:48.728
Why won't you quit?!

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:51.845
I guess I like Brooklyn not
being sucked into a black hole.

00:20:51.952 --> 00:20:53.439
I think I'm gonna go.

00:20:53.533 --> 00:20:55.963
Staten Island, maybe.
Not Brooklyn.

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.729
No! No!

00:21:24.171 --> 00:21:26.562
Whoa!

00:21:26.784 --> 00:21:29.080
Oh! What now?

00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:31.416
What is this place?

00:21:57.752 --> 00:21:59.641
Did you know your shoes
are untied?

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:02.913
Uh-huh.
This is a onesie,

00:22:02.999 --> 00:22:04.669
so I don't really
have to worry about it.

00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:13.884
I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.

00:22:14.344 --> 00:22:15.555
I don't wanna be.

00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:18.000
I don't think
you have a choice, kiddo.

00:22:18.813 --> 00:22:21.078
Got a lot going through
your head, I'm sure.

00:22:21.164 --> 00:22:22.344
Yeah.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.627
You're gonna be fine.
I can help you.

00:22:24.712 --> 00:22:26.997
If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.

00:22:27.156 --> 00:22:29.156
Yeah.

00:22:29.242 --> 00:22:32.851
I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick

00:22:32.937 --> 00:22:34.524
before the space-time
continuum collapses.

00:22:34.609 --> 00:22:35.828
Don't move.

00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:40.367
See you in a bit.

00:22:51.276 --> 00:22:52.978
How does he do that?

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.228
Is it here?
No, no, it's here.

00:22:58.313 --> 00:23:00.663
All right, folks.

00:23:00.748 --> 00:23:01.883
I always get this wrong.

00:23:03.352 --> 00:23:04.352
Oh, boy.

00:23:05.639 --> 00:23:06.639
Prowler.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.159
Man, I was in
the middle of something.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.810
I am so tired.

00:23:19.474 --> 00:23:21.896
Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.

00:23:29.178 --> 00:23:30.621
That all you got?

00:23:33.447 --> 00:23:34.963
Aw, so gross.

00:23:35.597 --> 00:23:37.660
I should go
up there and help him.

00:23:38.326 --> 00:23:40.529
Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.

00:23:46.351 --> 00:23:49.022
Watch out.
Here comes the Spider-Man.

00:23:50.078 --> 00:23:51.995
You like my new toy?

00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:56.576
Cost me a fortune, but, hey,
can't take it with you, right?

00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:59.851
You came all this way.
Watch the test.

00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:01.530
It's a hell of a freaking
light show.

00:24:01.616 --> 00:24:02.897
You're gonna love this.

00:24:05.507 --> 00:24:08.288
No! No,
don't do this! Stop!

00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:12.015
You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!

00:24:27.585 --> 00:24:29.968
I see multiple
dimensions opening!

00:24:30.054 --> 00:24:35.374
That was three, four
and five separate dimensions.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.811
It's unstable! We should stop.

00:24:50.092 --> 00:24:52.741
Norm, what's your take
on head trauma?

00:24:55.959 --> 00:24:57.995
I tried to warn you, pal.

00:25:11.004 --> 00:25:14.042
Goblin, no!
Get him outta there!

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.183
Wilson! Where are we?

00:25:23.846 --> 00:25:25.631
Really weird.

00:25:25.864 --> 00:25:27.542
Wilson!

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.886
Hey! Are you okay?

00:26:02.972 --> 00:26:05.573
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm just resting.

00:26:06.661 --> 00:26:08.315
Can't you get up?
Yeah.

00:26:08.409 --> 00:26:10.714
Yeah, I always get up.

00:26:12.965 --> 00:26:14.597
The coughing's
probably not a good sign.

00:26:14.683 --> 00:26:16.632
Find him. Now.

00:26:16.803 --> 00:26:19.925
Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.

00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:22.795
This override key is the only
way to stop the collider.

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:26.292
Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.

00:26:26.378 --> 00:26:27.854
You need to hide your face.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.972
You don't tell anyone
who you are.

00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:33.286
No one can know.
He's got everyone in his pocket.

00:26:33.382 --> 00:26:35.294
If he turns
the machine on again,

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.102
everything you know
will disappear.

00:26:37.187 --> 00:26:39.037
Your family, everyone.

00:26:39.122 --> 00:26:40.630
Everyone.

00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:43.912
Promise me
you'll do this.

00:26:48.515 --> 00:26:49.700
I promise.

00:26:50.018 --> 00:26:52.565
Go. Destroy the collider.

00:26:52.731 --> 00:26:54.011
I'll come and find you.

00:26:56.127 --> 00:26:57.500
It's gonna be okay.

00:27:05.528 --> 00:27:06.553
Tombstone.

00:27:06.639 --> 00:27:08.042
We're done with tests.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.972
Get that thing ready
to go again. And soon.

00:27:13.058 --> 00:27:14.659
Run faster!

00:27:14.849 --> 00:27:16.722
These guys are weak.

00:27:16.883 --> 00:27:19.727
I'd say it's nice
to see you again, Spider-Man,

00:27:19.813 --> 00:27:20.711
but it's not.

00:27:20.797 --> 00:27:22.539
Hey, Kingpin.
How's business?

00:27:22.625 --> 00:27:23.949
Boomin'. Heh.

00:27:24.034 --> 00:27:27.286
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

00:27:27.371 --> 00:27:30.370
This might open a
black hole under Brooklyn.

00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:32.324
It can't be worth the risk.

00:27:32.409 --> 00:27:35.604
It's not always
about the money, Spider-Man.

00:27:40.918 --> 00:27:43.042
Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?

00:27:43.248 --> 00:27:44.534
Wait.

00:27:45.488 --> 00:27:47.604
I know
what you're trying to do,

00:27:48.563 --> 00:27:50.279
and it won't work.

00:27:50.528 --> 00:27:51.930
They're gone.

00:28:05.578 --> 00:28:06.791
Get rid of the body.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.901
What was that?

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.682
Kill that guy.

00:28:48.117 --> 00:28:50.469
Stop sticking!

00:29:08.772 --> 00:29:12.006
Stand clear
of the closing doors, please.

00:29:37.235 --> 00:29:39.038
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

00:29:48.214 --> 00:29:50.324
Police! Put your hands up!

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.492
Miles? Miles?

00:29:53.182 --> 00:29:54.433
Why aren't you
at school?

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:57.771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

00:29:58.178 --> 00:30:00.362
Miles?
¿Qué te pasa?

00:30:03.211 --> 00:30:04.714
Is it the earthquake?

00:30:06.252 --> 00:30:07.736
Can I sleep here tonight?

00:30:07.821 --> 00:30:09.403
Miles.
It's a weeknight.

00:30:09.526 --> 00:30:10.719
You made a commitment
to that school.

00:30:10.804 --> 00:30:12.585
Jeff,
he's upset.

00:30:14.264 --> 00:30:17.007
Of course you can stay.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.421
Dad?
Yeah.

00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:24.710
Do you really hate
Spider-Man?

00:30:26.406 --> 00:30:29.210
Yeah. I mean, with
a vigilante, there is

00:30:29.296 --> 00:30:30.424
Jeff, mi amor.

00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:32.265
What? He asked me.

00:30:32.353 --> 00:30:34.858
Baby, you know how I feel
about Spider-Man. Come on.

00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:39.163
Tú sabes que
él te quiere mucho.

00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:41.687
That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?

00:30:42.366 --> 00:30:46.335
Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?

00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:49.382
Our family doesn't run
from things, Miles.

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:52.101
Yeah, I know.

00:30:55.368 --> 00:30:56.651
What's that about?

00:30:56.736 --> 00:30:58.420
He's having a hard time, Jeff.

00:30:58.505 --> 00:30:59.671
When it gets hard,

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.473
that's when
he's gotta stick it out.

00:31:07.905 --> 00:31:11.023
We interrupt this
broadcast for a special report.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.140
Sad news tonight.

00:31:13.257 --> 00:31:16.671
The hero known as Spider-Man
has died

00:31:16.827 --> 00:31:19.593
after injuries related to
another powerful earthquake

00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:22.179
in Brooklyn.
Multiple sources are confirming

00:31:22.265 --> 00:31:24.601
that Peter Parker,
a 26-year-old grad student

00:31:24.687 --> 00:31:26.296
and part-time photographer

00:31:26.382 --> 00:31:29.874
operated as Spider-Man
for at least a decade.

00:31:30.507 --> 00:31:33.522
I'm not runnin'
Runnin', runnin'

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:36.530
No, I'm not afraid
Of the fall

00:31:36.632 --> 00:31:39.760
I'm not scared

00:31:39.845 --> 00:31:42.596
He is survived
by his wife, Mary Jane,

00:31:42.681 --> 00:31:44.765
and his aunt, May Parker.

00:31:45.651 --> 00:31:48.369
Our hero, Spider-Man, is gone.

00:31:48.454 --> 00:31:49.804
I'm not scared

00:31:49.889 --> 00:31:51.788
My husband, Peter Parker,

00:31:52.524 --> 00:31:54.640
was an ordinary person.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.343
He always said it could've been
anyone behind the mask.

00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:01.554
He was just the kid
who happened to get bit.

00:32:02.959 --> 00:32:04.983
I'm going to miss him.

00:32:05.342 --> 00:32:06.352
Yeah.

00:32:06.438 --> 00:32:08.265
We were friends,
you know.

00:32:08.601 --> 00:32:10.324
Can I return it
if it doesn't fit?

00:32:10.409 --> 00:32:12.062
It always fits

00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:14.655
eventually.

00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:22.983
He didn't ask for his powers,

00:32:25.746 --> 00:32:28.216
but he chose to be Spider-Man.

00:32:29.482 --> 00:32:32.029
My favorite thing about Peter

00:32:32.115 --> 00:32:35.544
is that he made us each
feel powerful.

00:32:35.802 --> 00:32:39.720
We all have powers
of one kind or another.

00:32:39.857 --> 00:32:42.115
Of the dark

00:32:42.236 --> 00:32:43.982
But in our own way.

00:32:44.311 --> 00:32:46.450
We are all Spider-Man.

00:32:46.879 --> 00:32:48.997
And we're all
counting on you.

00:32:50.015 --> 00:32:51.798
They're counting on me.

00:32:51.943 --> 00:32:55.841
Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.

00:34:46.698 --> 00:34:48.643
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

00:34:49.283 --> 00:34:52.377
That thing you gave me,
that key.

00:34:53.533 --> 00:34:55.752
I think I really messed it up.

00:34:57.543 --> 00:34:59.471
I wanna do what you asked.

00:34:59.778 --> 00:35:01.496
I really do.

00:35:01.582 --> 00:35:04.448
But
I'm sorry.

00:35:04.901 --> 00:35:07.330
I'm not sure
I'm the guy.

00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:10.770
I can't do this
without you.

00:35:10.856 --> 00:35:12.340
Hey, kid.

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:15.713
Whoa!

00:35:19.302 --> 00:35:20.836
What did I do to him?!

00:35:31.971 --> 00:35:32.971
No.

00:35:37.324 --> 00:35:38.826
Who are you?

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:43.910
All right, people,
let's do this one last time.

00:35:45.858 --> 00:35:48.660
My name is Peter B. Parker.

00:35:49.207 --> 00:35:51.856
I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.

00:35:51.942 --> 00:35:53.762
And for the last 22 years,

00:35:53.908 --> 00:35:57.723
I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.

00:35:59.005 --> 00:36:00.554
What a day.

00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:02.824
I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.637
You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married,

00:36:05.723 --> 00:36:07.746
saved the city some more,
maybe too much.

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.824
My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.035
Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.

00:36:13.168 --> 00:36:16.160
Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.

00:36:16.246 --> 00:36:18.606
I broke my back,
a drone flew into my face,

00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:19.673
I buried Aunt May.

00:36:19.758 --> 00:36:21.775
My wife and I split up.

00:36:21.964 --> 00:36:24.167
But I handled it
like a champion.

00:36:24.324 --> 00:36:25.880
'Cause, you know what,

00:36:25.965 --> 00:36:27.715
no matter
how many times I get hit,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.617
I always get back up.

00:36:34.107 --> 00:36:37.317
And I got a lot of time
to reflect and work on myself.

00:36:37.602 --> 00:36:40.942
Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:42.896
Could you imagine?

00:36:42.982 --> 00:36:46.223
A seahorse seeing
another seahorse

00:36:46.317 --> 00:36:47.968
and then making it work?

00:36:49.262 --> 00:36:51.153
She wanted kids and

00:36:51.723 --> 00:36:53.309
And it scared me.

00:36:55.192 --> 00:36:57.317
I'm pretty sure
I broke her heart.

00:36:57.725 --> 00:37:00.225
Flash forward: I'm in
my apartment doing push-ups,

00:37:00.311 --> 00:37:02.225
doing ab crunches,
getting strong,

00:37:02.357 --> 00:37:04.694
when this weird thing
happened.

00:37:04.803 --> 00:37:07.631
And I gotta say, weird things
happen to me a lot.

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:11.186
But this was real weird.

00:37:53.353 --> 00:37:54.651
Ow!

00:37:56.087 --> 00:37:58.956
You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.

00:37:59.447 --> 00:38:01.628
Also, I was dead.

00:38:02.027 --> 00:38:03.534
And blond.

00:38:03.695 --> 00:38:05.499
I was kind of perfect.

00:38:05.968 --> 00:38:09.085
It was like
looking in a mirror.

00:38:09.896 --> 00:38:11.734
I have a feeling that
the thing

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.343
that brought me here

00:38:13.429 --> 00:38:15.546
was the thing
that got him killed.

00:38:16.304 --> 00:38:18.059
You wanna know
what happened next?

00:38:22.312 --> 00:38:23.588
Me, too.

00:38:23.682 --> 00:38:24.913
Who are you?

00:38:24.999 --> 00:38:26.718
What are
you doin' over there?

00:38:26.915 --> 00:38:28.913
Freeze! P.D.N.Y.

00:38:29.236 --> 00:38:30.305
Stop!

00:38:34.626 --> 00:38:36.610
Are you kidding me right now?

00:38:36.695 --> 00:38:38.079
Stop! Stop!

00:38:38.164 --> 00:38:39.780
I gotcha. I gotcha.

00:38:39.865 --> 00:38:41.668
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

00:38:44.003 --> 00:38:46.720
Hey, kid. Get over here!
Come on, now!

00:38:46.805 --> 00:38:47.805
Whoa.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.825
See you, officers!

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.178
Aw, come on.

00:38:58.851 --> 00:39:01.202
Hey, kid.
Kid, come on, now!

00:39:01.287 --> 00:39:02.989
Put 'em up, son!

00:39:07.258 --> 00:39:08.463
Uh adiós?

00:39:12.331 --> 00:39:15.174
Help!
Somebody stop that train!

00:39:32.751 --> 00:39:34.302
Oh, hey. What the?

00:39:38.029 --> 00:39:39.402
Sorry.

00:39:41.938 --> 00:39:45.543
I'm gonna die!

00:39:49.394 --> 00:39:51.872
Looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man

00:39:51.957 --> 00:39:54.277
dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.965
Yes! I didn't kill you.

00:39:58.051 --> 00:39:59.574
Who are you?
Who are you?

00:39:59.659 --> 00:40:00.824
Why are you trying to kill me?
I'm not.

00:40:00.909 --> 00:40:02.754
I'm trying to save you.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.217
Hey, maybe you
guys can go around?

00:40:24.302 --> 00:40:27.770
All right. Thanks, New York.

00:40:38.027 --> 00:40:39.879
What was that?

00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:42.184
Kid electrocuted me

00:40:42.426 --> 00:40:43.894
with his hands.

00:40:47.457 --> 00:40:49.943
You're like me.
I got some questions.

00:40:54.365 --> 00:40:56.281
Why do you look like
Peter Parker?

00:40:58.996 --> 00:41:00.287
Because I am Peter Parker.

00:41:00.372 --> 00:41:03.043
Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?

00:41:03.129 --> 00:41:05.457
Why are you older?
And why is your body

00:41:05.543 --> 00:41:06.785
a-a different shape?

00:41:06.871 --> 00:41:08.160
Pretty sure
you just called me fat.

00:41:08.245 --> 00:41:09.504
No. No, you just

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.052
Atleast, you don't look
so hot either, kid.

00:41:11.137 --> 00:41:13.035
Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.

00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:14.363
Are you a ghost?
No.

00:41:14.449 --> 00:41:15.528
Are you a zombie?
Stop it.

00:41:15.613 --> 00:41:16.966
Am I a zombie?
You're not even close.

00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:19.496
Are you from another dimension?
Like a parallel universe

00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:21.177
where things are like
this universe but different?

00:41:21.262 --> 00:41:23.199
And you're Spider-Man
in that universe?

00:41:23.285 --> 00:41:24.996
But somehow traveled
to this universe,

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.205
but you don't know how?

00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:27.980
Wow. That was really
just a guess?

00:41:28.066 --> 00:41:29.777
We learned about it
in physics.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.821
Quantum theory.
This is amazing!

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.074
You can teach me
like Peter said he would.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.434
Before he died. Yeah, right.
Yeah. Exactly.

00:41:36.637 --> 00:41:37.965
Look, I made a promise
to him.

00:41:38.051 --> 00:41:39.667
Here's lesson number one,
kid.

00:41:39.791 --> 00:41:42.895
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

00:41:47.519 --> 00:41:49.456
Peter, seriously

00:41:51.323 --> 00:41:53.407
Trust me, kid.

00:41:53.492 --> 00:41:55.600
This'll all make you
a better Spider-Man.

00:42:00.965 --> 00:42:02.819
Hey, are you okay?

00:42:02.905 --> 00:42:04.006
No, I'm not.

00:42:04.092 --> 00:42:05.412
What's going on
with your body?

00:42:05.498 --> 00:42:06.843
I don't think my atoms
are real jazzed

00:42:06.928 --> 00:42:08.613
about being
in the wrong dimension.

00:42:11.242 --> 00:42:13.093
Look, I'm not looking
for a side gig

00:42:13.178 --> 00:42:14.494
as a Spider-Man coach.

00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:16.796
I got a lot going on
in my dimension.

00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:18.898
"With great power
comes great"

00:42:18.983 --> 00:42:20.501
Don't you dare
finish that sentence.

00:42:20.586 --> 00:42:22.269
Don't do it!
I'm sick of it.

00:42:26.299 --> 00:42:29.043
Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.

00:42:29.128 --> 00:42:30.260
I don't have a choice!

00:42:30.354 --> 00:42:31.783
Kingpin's got
a supercollider.

00:42:31.869 --> 00:42:33.206
He's trying to kill me.
Wait a second.

00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:35.378
What did you just say?
Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

00:42:35.463 --> 00:42:37.510
Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?

00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:39.253
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

00:42:39.338 --> 00:42:40.458
Goodbye.
Where you going?

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:41.799
When it runs again,
I'll jump in

00:42:41.885 --> 00:42:43.523
and get back to my life.
You can't let them run it.

00:42:43.608 --> 00:42:44.744
I'm supposed to destroy it

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:47.065
so it never runs again
or everyone's gonna die.

00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:50.947
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

00:42:51.033 --> 00:42:53.479
But there's always a little bit
of time before everybody dies

00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:55.088
and that's when I do
my best work.

00:42:55.174 --> 00:42:56.697
Aren't you gonna
need this?

00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:58.447
Aw, you have a goober.
Give it.

00:42:58.533 --> 00:43:02.072
W-W-Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.

00:43:02.158 --> 00:43:04.811
There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.

00:43:04.896 --> 00:43:07.214
I can never remember,
so I always call it a goober. Give it.

00:43:07.299 --> 00:43:08.950
I need it
to destroy the collider.

00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:10.359
I need it to go home.

00:43:10.445 --> 00:43:12.174
No. I'll swallow it.
Don't play with me.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.158
What? Hey?
I said

00:43:14.244 --> 00:43:16.361
The collider created a portal
that brought me here.

00:43:16.447 --> 00:43:17.996
And I have to get

00:43:18.276 --> 00:43:22.329
Did you break this?
No, it broke.

00:43:22.557 --> 00:43:23.791
I don't remember
what happened.

00:43:23.892 --> 00:43:25.494
See, this is why
I never had kids.

00:43:25.584 --> 00:43:27.066
Can't we make another one?

00:43:27.151 --> 00:43:29.236
We can't do anything.
Thanks to you,

00:43:29.346 --> 00:43:32.072
I have to re-steal what
your guy stole from Alchemax

00:43:32.157 --> 00:43:34.941
and make another one of these.

00:43:35.026 --> 00:43:36.976
If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave,

00:43:37.061 --> 00:43:38.315
everyone in this city,

00:43:38.401 --> 00:43:41.510
my parents, my uncle and
millions of others, will die.

00:43:41.596 --> 00:43:43.017
And you're just gonna
go home

00:43:43.102 --> 00:43:45.318
and leave me here
to figure this out for myself?

00:43:45.534 --> 00:43:48.072
You good with that, Spider-Man?
Yeah.

00:43:58.117 --> 00:43:59.979
What are you doing?

00:44:00.157 --> 00:44:03.902
Making you feel guilty.
Is it working?

00:44:03.988 --> 00:44:06.173
How could it? No.
Look at me.

00:44:06.258 --> 00:44:07.768
Does it look like
it's working?

00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:11.502
No. No, it's not

00:44:13.698 --> 00:44:18.204
No! No! No!
Do not let him win!

00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:20.619
All right, kid. You win.

00:44:20.729 --> 00:44:22.963
Come on, we don't have
a second to lose.

00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:25.799
Mmm. I love this burger.
So delicious.

00:44:25.885 --> 00:44:27.713
One of the best burgers
I've ever had.

00:44:27.799 --> 00:44:30.182
In my universe, this place
closed six years ago.

00:44:30.268 --> 00:44:32.393
Hmm. I don't know why.
I really don't.

00:44:32.479 --> 00:44:33.670
Mmm.

00:44:35.666 --> 00:44:38.137
You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.

00:44:38.222 --> 00:44:39.939
Can we focus?
Mm-hm. Sure.

00:44:40.025 --> 00:44:42.562
The other Peter
You gonna eat that?

00:44:43.752 --> 00:44:44.838
I'm listening.

00:44:44.981 --> 00:44:46.565
The other Peter said
he was gonna be

00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:48.236
showing me the ropes.
Wow.

00:44:48.322 --> 00:44:50.822
You got any Spider-Man
tips you can tell me now?

00:44:50.908 --> 00:44:52.119
Yeah, I got plenty.

00:44:52.236 --> 00:44:53.586
Disinfect the mask.

00:44:53.798 --> 00:44:55.854
You're gonna wanna use
baby powder in the suit,

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.058
heavy on the joints.

00:44:57.144 --> 00:44:59.307
You don't want
any chafing, right?

00:44:59.627 --> 00:45:01.729
Anything else?
Nope, that was everything.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.736
I think you're gonna be
a bad teacher.

00:45:03.822 --> 00:45:06.057
Uh-uh-uh?
Look up where Alchemax is.

00:45:06.251 --> 00:45:09.619
"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."

00:45:09.744 --> 00:45:11.088
You can teach me

00:45:11.174 --> 00:45:12.305
to swing on the way there.

00:45:15.433 --> 00:45:17.533
I'm not swinging to
the Hudson Valley, Miles.

00:45:17.619 --> 00:45:19.913
Not after a hearty
burger breakfast.

00:45:19.999 --> 00:45:22.611
Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.

00:45:24.202 --> 00:45:26.424
I can see a new horizon

00:45:26.799 --> 00:45:28.354
Underneath the blazing sky

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.392
I'll be where the eagle's
Flying higher

00:45:31.565 --> 00:45:33.900
And it's a no on the cape.
I think it's cool.

00:45:33.986 --> 00:45:35.518
Take that off.
It's disrespectful.

00:45:35.604 --> 00:45:37.658
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:40.366
So how do we
retrace Peter's steps?

00:45:40.432 --> 00:45:41.854
That's a good question.

00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:45.038
What would I do
if I were me?

00:45:46.538 --> 00:45:47.577
Got it.

00:45:47.663 --> 00:45:49.342
I infiltrate the lab.

00:45:49.427 --> 00:45:51.514
Find the head scientist's
computer.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.429
That lady with the
bike is the head scientist.

00:45:53.514 --> 00:45:54.858
I saw her
in this documentary.

00:45:54.944 --> 00:45:57.702
Cool! Step Three:
I reexamine my personal biases.

00:45:57.788 --> 00:45:59.252
I hack the computer.

00:45:59.338 --> 00:46:00.553
It's not technically
hacking.

00:46:00.639 --> 00:46:02.733
Not now. I just lost
my train of thought.

00:46:02.835 --> 00:46:04.835
Download the important stuff.

00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:06.360
I'll know it when I see it.

00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:09.381
I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.

00:46:09.499 --> 00:46:11.210
So, what am I doing?

00:46:11.319 --> 00:46:14.210
You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.

00:46:14.296 --> 00:46:16.737
Look, man. You gotta teach me
how to do Spider-Man stuff

00:46:16.822 --> 00:46:18.338
or I won't be able
to help.

00:46:19.665 --> 00:46:22.350
Watch and learn, kid!
I'll quiz ya later!

00:46:25.344 --> 00:46:26.837
Why did I get stuck with

00:46:26.923 --> 00:46:28.715
the janky, old, broke
hobo Spider-Man?!

00:46:30.335 --> 00:46:31.696
That's new.

00:46:41.447 --> 00:46:42.844
Kingpin.

00:46:46.517 --> 00:46:48.135
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.655
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

00:46:58.697 --> 00:47:00.198
Whoa!

00:47:06.603 --> 00:47:08.009
Peter!

00:47:08.273 --> 00:47:09.837
Peter!

00:47:10.287 --> 00:47:11.571
Peter!

00:47:11.657 --> 00:47:13.494
What are you doing here?
Kingpin's here.

00:47:13.579 --> 00:47:14.907
Just move over.

00:47:14.993 --> 00:47:17.704
You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.353
No! I can't sit there
and let Spider-Man die

00:47:20.439 --> 00:47:21.565
without doing anything
about it.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.243
I'm not doing that again.

00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:25.688
What?

00:47:25.889 --> 00:47:29.095
Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me,

00:47:30.048 --> 00:47:31.923
so you're
a nice change of pace.

00:47:32.633 --> 00:47:35.064
Mr. Fisk!
Look at this data.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:36.650
I know you can't
really understand it,

00:47:36.735 --> 00:47:38.704
but these are
really good numbers.

00:47:39.338 --> 00:47:40.775
And I got the password.

00:47:40.861 --> 00:47:43.673
Mr. Fisk.
If we fire again this week

00:47:43.759 --> 00:47:46.226
there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.

00:47:46.376 --> 00:47:47.939
You see this? And this?

00:47:48.025 --> 00:47:49.396
This is multiple dimensions

00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:52.173
beginning to crash
into each other.

00:47:52.259 --> 00:47:53.800
This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes.

00:47:53.885 --> 00:47:55.568
You get used to it.
Watch this.

00:47:55.653 --> 00:47:58.103
He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."

00:47:58.189 --> 00:47:59.751
You've got 24 hours.

00:47:59.837 --> 00:48:01.809
What this means is there
could be a rupture

00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:03.316
in the space-time
continuum.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:04.545
Ooh. That's bad.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.146
Actually, everything
she said was bad.

00:48:06.231 --> 00:48:07.508
I was lying before.

00:48:15.773 --> 00:48:18.577
Okay. Hold on.
Let me get you some more data.

00:48:20.273 --> 00:48:22.842
What are you doing, bud?
I can't move.

00:48:22.928 --> 00:48:24.663
Okay, relax your fingers.

00:48:24.749 --> 00:48:27.700
We don't have time.
Just let go. Be in the moment.

00:48:27.785 --> 00:48:29.802
I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.

00:48:29.887 --> 00:48:32.472
I'm not refusing.
No more excuses.

00:48:32.557 --> 00:48:34.141
I just need more time.

00:48:34.226 --> 00:48:36.242
They're right there.
They're gonna see you.

00:48:36.327 --> 00:48:38.177
Miles, you gotta unstick.

00:48:38.262 --> 00:48:40.113
What do you do to relax?

00:48:40.198 --> 00:48:42.966
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.786
Needless to say, I

00:48:46.872 --> 00:48:48.387
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:48:48.472 --> 00:48:51.157
Callin' it quits
Now, baby, I'm a wreck

00:48:52.744 --> 00:48:55.528
You're a wreck, ooh

00:48:57.883 --> 00:49:00.692
just the worst.

00:49:02.871 --> 00:49:04.871
Miles, where did you go?
I'm right here.

00:49:04.956 --> 00:49:08.307
Where? I can't see ya.
I'm right in front of you.

00:49:08.392 --> 00:49:10.843
Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
Not in my universe.

00:49:10.928 --> 00:49:12.836
Aah! You just poked me
in my eye!

00:49:12.922 --> 00:49:15.266
This is incredible.
Some kind of fight or flight thing.

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:16.618
What's that?

00:49:19.237 --> 00:49:20.611
Remember this password.
Come on.

00:49:20.697 --> 00:49:22.635
D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D
Slow down!

00:49:22.736 --> 00:49:27.213
4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.
I need to write it down!

00:49:27.299 --> 00:49:28.424
Download the schematic.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.338
How do I do that?
While I turn on the charm.

00:49:32.914 --> 00:49:34.333
Spider-Man?

00:49:34.419 --> 00:49:36.682
Oh, hey.
Didn't see you there.

00:49:36.768 --> 00:49:38.135
Wow.

00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:40.604
Okay, I'm kinda
freaking out right now.

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.440
You're supposed to be dead.

00:49:42.526 --> 00:49:45.519
Surprise! O-Okay.
That's-That's a no-no.

00:49:45.605 --> 00:49:47.332
We don't like that.
This is fascinating.

00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:48.855
Okay, that's my face.

00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:51.417
An entirely different
Peter Parker.

00:49:51.503 --> 00:49:54.253
Little bit of a gut, perhaps
from dimensional warping.

00:49:54.338 --> 00:49:56.894
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.
I was way flatter before I warped.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.512
Travel through the multiverse

00:49:59.598 --> 00:50:00.809
appears to have
deteriorated the

00:50:00.894 --> 00:50:02.814
What was the rest?!

00:50:04.285 --> 00:50:05.667
Hey, how old are you?

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:08.367
'Cause you don't look
a day over 35.

00:50:08.453 --> 00:50:10.341
They said I was crazy!
They said I was crazy!

00:50:10.426 --> 00:50:12.824
You showed
'em you're not crazy.

00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:15.566
This might pinch a little.

00:50:17.324 --> 00:50:19.496
I know. I just need
to get these samples.

00:50:19.582 --> 00:50:20.455
Okay.

00:50:20.541 --> 00:50:22.259
Organize your desktop, lady.

00:50:22.345 --> 00:50:25.824
Wow. Just complete
cellular decay.

00:50:26.674 --> 00:50:28.199
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:50:28.285 --> 00:50:29.598
What are you doing?

00:50:29.684 --> 00:50:31.824
I'm just taking the whole thing.

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.492
And obviously
you've been glitching.

00:50:33.668 --> 00:50:36.746
"Glitchin'"? No.
Why would you even say that?

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.449
If you stay in this dimension
too long,

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:40.004
your body's gonna
disintegrate.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:42.176
Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?

00:50:42.262 --> 00:50:45.082
I don't know.
You can't imagine.

00:50:45.243 --> 00:50:47.194
And I, for one,

00:50:47.506 --> 00:50:49.301
can't wait to watch.

00:50:51.128 --> 00:50:52.558
What did you say
your name was?

00:50:52.644 --> 00:50:54.590
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

00:51:03.051 --> 00:51:05.025
Can I assume that your friends
call you Doc Ock?

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.238
My friends
actually call me Liv.

00:51:07.546 --> 00:51:10.176
My enemies
call me Doc Ock.

00:51:10.262 --> 00:51:11.597
I got this! Run!

00:51:11.683 --> 00:51:13.532
Who are you talking to?

00:51:15.486 --> 00:51:18.405
I got it!
Oh, you "got it," Peter?

00:51:20.358 --> 00:51:22.317
I got it handled, buddy!

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.973
Everything is fine!

00:51:27.915 --> 00:51:30.949
Okay, this is a little bit bad.
You're chatty.

00:51:31.163 --> 00:51:32.605
Gotta go.

00:51:35.139 --> 00:51:37.742
This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:42.863
Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.

00:51:42.948 --> 00:51:45.365
Peter!

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:48.744
You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.970
Could you give me that back,
young man?

00:51:51.055 --> 00:51:52.972
Peter!

00:51:53.057 --> 00:51:55.494
It's proprietary.

00:52:00.009 --> 00:52:01.727
Oh.

00:52:01.867 --> 00:52:02.883
This'd be a good time

00:52:02.968 --> 00:52:04.550
to turn invisible.
Yep.

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:07.753
Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.

00:52:07.838 --> 00:52:09.456
Act super normal.

00:52:09.541 --> 00:52:10.590
Spider-Man?

00:52:10.675 --> 00:52:11.791
You know, that's funny,

00:52:11.876 --> 00:52:13.492
I get that a lot.
Hey.

00:52:13.577 --> 00:52:15.729
Spider-Man?
Hey! Hands up!

00:52:15.814 --> 00:52:17.094
Now we do
a switchy-switchy.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.353
What?
Get back here!

00:52:18.438 --> 00:52:19.633
Where do you think
you're going?

00:52:19.718 --> 00:52:21.668
He took a bagel!
Time to swing,

00:52:21.753 --> 00:52:23.922
just like I taught ya.
When did you teach me that?

00:52:24.008 --> 00:52:26.086
I didn't. It's a little joke
for team-building.

00:52:26.261 --> 00:52:27.944
Hey! Hey!
Hey!

00:52:28.415 --> 00:52:30.306
All right, you ready?
Of course I'm not ready!

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.847
I can't do this yet!

00:52:33.932 --> 00:52:35.813
Everybody knows
that the best way to learn

00:52:35.899 --> 00:52:38.321
is under intense
life-threatening pressure.

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:43.032
Oh! Come on, come on, come on.

00:52:46.945 --> 00:52:48.305
Uh-oh.

00:52:53.885 --> 00:52:55.961
What are you doing down there?

00:52:56.047 --> 00:52:57.954
I run better than I swing.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.807
You gotta swing
or they'll catch you.

00:53:01.008 --> 00:53:02.782
This is what you wanted.

00:53:08.756 --> 00:53:10.008
Uh-oh.

00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:17.579
Come back, little boy.

00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:20.180
Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.

00:53:20.266 --> 00:53:22.496
Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!

00:53:22.581 --> 00:53:23.938
Don't shoot off
your back foot.

00:53:24.048 --> 00:53:26.899
That's too many things!
Then stop listening to me!

00:53:26.985 --> 00:53:30.250
That's the best idea
you've had all day!

00:53:36.894 --> 00:53:39.094
Nice, Miles!

00:53:42.632 --> 00:53:44.483
I'm doin' it.
Good. You're doin' it.

00:53:44.568 --> 00:53:47.086
Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.

00:53:47.171 --> 00:53:48.954
Okay.
Thwip and release.

00:53:49.039 --> 00:53:52.071
And thwip. Release. Thwip.
And release.

00:53:52.157 --> 00:53:53.959
You're a natural. Thwip. And release!
Thwip. Release.

00:53:54.044 --> 00:53:56.407
Feel the rhythm?
Thwip. And release!

00:53:56.493 --> 00:53:57.680
Good, Miles.

00:53:57.766 --> 00:54:00.102
I gotta say,
you're amazing, man.

00:54:00.188 --> 00:54:01.534
We're a little team!

00:54:01.619 --> 00:54:03.602
Me as the teacher
who could still do it.

00:54:03.688 --> 00:54:06.539
You as the student who can
do it, just not as good.

00:54:06.735 --> 00:54:09.461
I'm proud of us. Is there
something you want to say to me?

00:54:11.423 --> 00:54:12.770
Peter!

00:54:25.293 --> 00:54:26.926
What the?
Who did that?

00:54:53.559 --> 00:54:54.588
Hey, guys.

00:54:54.673 --> 00:54:55.722
Gwanda?

00:54:55.807 --> 00:54:57.387
It's Gwen, actually.

00:54:57.473 --> 00:55:00.493
Oh, you know her.
Very cool.

00:55:00.579 --> 00:55:02.152
I'm from another dimension.

00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:05.231
I mean,
another-another dimension.

00:55:05.317 --> 00:55:08.449
All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.

00:55:08.535 --> 00:55:09.903
My name is Gwen Stacy.

00:55:09.988 --> 00:55:12.738
I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.

00:55:12.823 --> 00:55:14.270
And for the last two years,

00:55:14.356 --> 00:55:17.541
I've been the one
and only Spider-Woman.

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.574
You guys know the rest.

00:55:19.846 --> 00:55:21.315
I joined a band.

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:24.395
Saved my dad.

00:55:27.606 --> 00:55:30.324
I couldn't save my best friend,

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:31.699
Peter Parker,

00:55:33.559 --> 00:55:35.809
so now I save everyone else.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.598
And I don't do friends
anymore,

00:55:38.916 --> 00:55:40.926
just to avoid
any distractions.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:46.285
And one day
this weird thing happened.

00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:49.327
And I mean, like,
really weird.

00:55:54.885 --> 00:55:57.066
I was blown into last week.

00:56:01.106 --> 00:56:02.598
Literally.

00:56:02.975 --> 00:56:06.676
I landed in New York,
but not my New York.

00:56:08.184 --> 00:56:09.481
Lucky for these folks,

00:56:09.597 --> 00:56:11.465
Spider-Man was there
to save the day.

00:56:11.891 --> 00:56:14.918
My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.

00:56:15.092 --> 00:56:17.199
You guys are early.

00:56:17.285 --> 00:56:20.176
Wasn't sure why
until I met you.

00:56:20.262 --> 00:56:21.449
Oh!

00:56:22.126 --> 00:56:23.512
I like your haircut.

00:56:23.606 --> 00:56:25.211
You don't get to like
my haircut.

00:56:25.297 --> 00:56:26.504
Let's go.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:27.922
How many more Spider-People
are there?

00:56:28.007 --> 00:56:29.207
Save it
for Comic-Con.

00:56:29.293 --> 00:56:31.239
What's Comic-Con?
Whoa!

00:56:48.153 --> 00:56:49.551
You're dead, Spider-Man.

00:56:49.644 --> 00:56:52.176
Wilson!
What are you doing?

00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:54.918
Vanessa.
Richard, come on.

00:56:58.184 --> 00:56:59.968
Vanessa! Richard!

00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:01.543
No!

00:57:01.648 --> 00:57:04.132
Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

00:57:23.066 --> 00:57:24.950
I killed Spider-Man.

00:57:25.323 --> 00:57:27.559
Why did I just see two more?

00:57:27.645 --> 00:57:29.691
There's three, actually.

00:57:29.816 --> 00:57:32.488
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.

00:57:32.621 --> 00:57:34.395
This means
you get what you want.

00:57:34.481 --> 00:57:36.488
It means my collider works.

00:57:37.179 --> 00:57:40.762
All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.

00:57:40.987 --> 00:57:43.309
And the collider will bring
your family back.

00:57:43.582 --> 00:57:46.473
As many families
as you want.

00:57:55.168 --> 00:57:57.410
Tomorrow, at my collider.

00:57:58.038 --> 00:58:00.012
Our collider.

00:58:03.426 --> 00:58:04.716
He broke this?

00:58:04.802 --> 00:58:07.059
Yeah. He's actually
really embarrassed about it,

00:58:07.145 --> 00:58:09.426
so just keep
it between us, okay?

00:58:10.934 --> 00:58:12.686
I know where we
can make a new one.

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.503
And we won't let him
break it this time.

00:58:17.665 --> 00:58:19.590
I'm sorry about your friend.

00:58:20.878 --> 00:58:22.262
Thanks, Miles.

00:58:24.314 --> 00:58:26.032
I know
how hard this is.

00:58:26.117 --> 00:58:28.379
To have to figure
this stuff out on your own.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:32.098
It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.

00:58:32.192 --> 00:58:33.235
Yeah.

00:58:34.825 --> 00:58:37.301
If you ever decide
to do friends again,

00:58:37.414 --> 00:58:39.395
I could always open up a slot.

00:58:40.065 --> 00:58:42.782
I'll keep you posted.

00:58:43.414 --> 00:58:44.981
Cool.

00:58:49.906 --> 00:58:51.622
We should probably go.

00:58:51.708 --> 00:58:54.410
Peter, we're
literally on the doorstep.

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:55.676
Bad idea. Bad idea.

00:58:55.762 --> 00:58:57.302
Just relax.
This is a bad idea.

00:58:57.387 --> 00:58:59.104
You guys are all very sweet,

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:01.238
but no more fans today,
please.

00:59:05.179 --> 00:59:07.043
I'm not ready for this.

00:59:11.489 --> 00:59:12.879
Peter?

00:59:14.965 --> 00:59:16.660
Hey, Aunt May.

00:59:17.098 --> 00:59:18.871
So this is gonna
sound crazy,

00:59:18.957 --> 00:59:21.199
but I'm pretty sure
that I'm from an

00:59:21.471 --> 00:59:23.512
An alternate dimension.

00:59:23.598 --> 00:59:24.900
Yeah.

00:59:26.168 --> 00:59:28.145
You look tired, Peter.

00:59:28.277 --> 00:59:29.988
Well, I am tired.

00:59:30.074 --> 00:59:33.566
And older. And thicker.
Yeah. I've heard that already.

00:59:33.652 --> 00:59:35.840
Oh, jeez.
Are those sweatpants?

00:59:35.966 --> 00:59:38.316
Yup, that's what they are.

00:59:38.465 --> 00:59:40.098
I was there,

00:59:40.613 --> 00:59:42.474
when it all happened.

00:59:42.785 --> 00:59:44.551
I am so sorry.

00:59:44.762 --> 00:59:46.629
And what dimension
are you from?

00:59:46.811 --> 00:59:48.270
Brooklyn.

00:59:48.967 --> 00:59:52.301
Did Peter have a place where we
could make another one of these?

00:59:52.465 --> 00:59:54.027
A goober.

00:59:55.289 --> 00:59:56.465
Follow me.

01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:01.793
Oh, yeah,
I got one of these, too.

01:00:01.912 --> 01:00:03.996
A little, old shed
where I keep my Spider-gear.

01:00:16.593 --> 01:00:18.731
I mean,
this place is pretentious.

01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:27.438
Whoa.

01:00:32.075 --> 01:00:33.856
Dude. Was yours
anything like this?

01:00:33.942 --> 01:00:35.160
Mine was like this,

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.122
but take away the jeep,
the plane.

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:40.911
Imagine it way smaller.
Imagine a futon.

01:00:41.049 --> 01:00:43.684
I feel sad for this guy.

01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:58.934
Hey, Peter.

01:00:59.773 --> 01:01:01.856
I think this is a cape.

01:01:17.688 --> 01:01:20.919
Peter knew
how dangerous the job was.

01:01:21.369 --> 01:01:24.458
But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy

01:01:24.544 --> 01:01:26.200
was Spider-Man.

01:01:27.631 --> 01:01:29.514
Kingpin knows
we're coming.

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.483
We're going to be
outnumbered.

01:01:31.568 --> 01:01:33.645
Don't be
so sure.

01:01:33.909 --> 01:01:36.004
You might need these.

01:01:40.485 --> 01:01:43.950
You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.322
Hey, fellas.

01:01:47.517 --> 01:01:49.012
Is he
in black and white?

01:01:49.098 --> 01:01:51.262
Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.

01:01:51.418 --> 01:01:53.489
Wherever I go,
the wind follows.

01:01:53.574 --> 01:01:56.606
And the wind,
it smells like rain.

01:01:57.128 --> 01:01:58.262
Hi, guys!

01:01:58.349 --> 01:02:00.117
Speaking Japanese

01:02:03.692 --> 01:02:06.051
This could literally not
get any weirder.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.606
It can get weirder.

01:02:08.848 --> 01:02:12.036
I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.

01:02:12.489 --> 01:02:13.958
No other reason.

01:02:21.713 --> 01:02:23.549
You're like me.

01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:27.709
My name is Peter Parker.

01:02:27.795 --> 01:02:29.201
My name is Peni Parker.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.256
My name is Peter Porker.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.233
I was bitten by.
I was bitten by

01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:34.115
a radioactive spider.
A radioactive pig.

01:02:34.532 --> 01:02:36.725
In my universe, it's 1933,

01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:38.037
and I'm a private eye.

01:02:38.123 --> 01:02:39.475
I like to drink egg creams,

01:02:39.561 --> 01:02:41.936
and I like to fight Nazis.
A lot.

01:02:42.022 --> 01:02:44.071
I'm from New
York in the year 3145.

01:02:44.207 --> 01:02:45.787
I have a psychic link
with a spider

01:02:45.873 --> 01:02:47.608
who lives inside
my father's robot.

01:02:47.757 --> 01:02:50.061
And we're best friends.
Forever.

01:02:50.147 --> 01:02:52.273
Sometimes I let
matches burn down to my fingertips

01:02:52.358 --> 01:02:53.740
just to feel something,
anything.

01:02:54.998 --> 01:02:56.889
I'm a photographer
for the Daily Beagle.

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:59.154
When I'm not pooching around,
I'm working like a dog,

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.889
trying to sniff out
the latest story.

01:03:01.059 --> 01:03:02.874
I frolic and I dance
And I do this With my pants

01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:04.476
Okay! Enough!

01:03:05.272 --> 01:03:08.014
So how did you
get here?

01:03:08.099 --> 01:03:10.334
Well, it's kind of
a long story.

01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:16.272
Maybe not
that long.

01:03:16.686 --> 01:03:19.365
And now we're just trying
to find a way home.

01:03:21.287 --> 01:03:24.311
The only way home is back
through that collider gizmo.

01:03:24.397 --> 01:03:25.404
The only trouble is

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:28.643
One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.

01:03:28.912 --> 01:03:30.168
I'll do it. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

01:03:30.253 --> 01:03:32.572
No, no, no.
You guys don't get it.

01:03:32.657 --> 01:03:33.928
Don't get what?

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:42.190
None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.

01:03:42.542 --> 01:03:44.690
I'm the guy
who's gonna turn it off.

01:03:44.831 --> 01:03:48.065
And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.

01:03:48.573 --> 01:03:52.651
Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.

01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:58.465
Who are you
again?

01:03:58.551 --> 01:03:59.868
This is Miles.

01:03:59.954 --> 01:04:01.438
And he's gonna save
the multiverse.

01:04:01.524 --> 01:04:03.790
Yeah, man.
This kid can turn himself invisible.

01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:05.922
Watch this.
He can do it now.

01:04:08.758 --> 01:04:12.000
I can't do it on command.
He can't do it on command.

01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:14.790
But it is cool. Show 'em
the zappy thing, Miles.

01:04:16.402 --> 01:04:19.821
Can't do it on command.
He can't do it on command.

01:04:19.907 --> 01:04:22.040
But he can do so much more.
What else do you do?

01:04:22.126 --> 01:04:24.943
Just those two things.
Just those two things.

01:04:25.175 --> 01:04:26.592
Aw, man.

01:04:26.677 --> 01:04:31.283
Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.

01:04:32.441 --> 01:04:34.188
I think he's gonna
get us home.

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:37.915
Okay, little fella,

01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:40.106
Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.

01:04:40.191 --> 01:04:42.430
I'm talkin' hard boys,
real biscuit boxers.

01:04:42.516 --> 01:04:43.961
Can you fight them
all off at once?

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.141
I haven't actually
fought anyone.

01:04:46.243 --> 01:04:47.680
Surprise attack!

01:04:49.066 --> 01:04:51.516
Can you rewire a mainframe
while being shot at?

01:04:51.602 --> 01:04:52.584
Can I what?
Show me!

01:04:52.669 --> 01:04:54.420
Surprise attack!

01:04:54.505 --> 01:04:56.255
Can you swing and flip with
the grace of a trained dancer?

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.259
Can you close off your feelings
so you don't get crippled

01:04:58.344 --> 01:05:00.181
by the moral ambiguity
of your violent actions?

01:05:00.266 --> 01:05:02.361
Can you help your aunt create
an online dating profile

01:05:02.446 --> 01:05:04.361
so she can get out of
the dang house once in a while?

01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:06.899
Can you float through the air
when you smell a delicious pie?

01:05:06.985 --> 01:05:08.352
What?
Can you be strong?

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.703
Ruthless?
Disciplined?

01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:10.774
I don't know. Maybe.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.665
Psychic?
Show me some moxie, soldier!

01:05:12.797 --> 01:05:15.407
Above all, no matter
how many times you get hit,

01:05:15.492 --> 01:05:16.842
can you get back up?

01:05:16.927 --> 01:05:18.811
'Cause when a Spider-Man
is on the floor

01:05:18.896 --> 01:05:20.713
When you think
you can't keep goin'

01:05:20.798 --> 01:05:23.016
Come on, Miles.
Come on. You can do it.

01:05:23.102 --> 01:05:24.969
You can do this.
Guys, cool it.

01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:27.753
Come on. You can do it!
Get up, Miles.

01:05:27.838 --> 01:05:29.874
Come on, Miles.
Get up.

01:05:36.086 --> 01:05:38.430
You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.

01:05:38.516 --> 01:05:39.969
He's not ready.
It's obvious.

01:05:40.055 --> 01:05:41.501
There's no way.
He's just a kid.

01:05:41.586 --> 01:05:42.702
If he can't do this,

01:05:42.787 --> 01:05:44.141
we have to stay
and do it for him.

01:05:44.227 --> 01:05:46.563
He's looking right at us
while we talk about him.

01:05:47.505 --> 01:05:48.855
Miles?

01:05:49.026 --> 01:05:50.103
Miles?

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.118
You see that?
He can, um

01:05:56.423 --> 01:05:58.072
He can turn invisible.

01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:04.159
When it gets dark
Outside

01:06:04.245 --> 01:06:07.269
In you I confide

01:06:07.382 --> 01:06:11.266
You help me face my demons
I won't hide

01:06:11.414 --> 01:06:13.432
Miles, what
is going on with you?

01:06:13.518 --> 01:06:16.081
Nobody's heard from you.
We don't know what's going on.

01:06:16.167 --> 01:06:19.073
If you're hidin' something from
us, you need to come clean.

01:06:19.256 --> 01:06:20.956
You call me back. Now.

01:06:22.531 --> 01:06:24.777
He's not answering me
either.

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.175
It's Aaron.
I'm outta town for a few days.

01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:31.956
I'll hit you when I'm back.
Peace.

01:06:32.042 --> 01:06:33.573
Aaron, it's Jeff.

01:06:34.438 --> 01:06:37.423
Look, I need you to call me
if you've heard from Miles.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:39.159
He has a

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:42.511
He has a soft spot for you,

01:06:43.101 --> 01:06:44.951
and we haven't heard
from him.

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:48.230
And you know I wouldn't reach
out if this wasn't important.

01:06:48.884 --> 01:06:50.485
Hope you're good.

01:06:52.389 --> 01:06:54.001
Dear Uncle Aaron.

01:06:54.189 --> 01:06:58.430
I gotta do something, and
I don't know if I can do it.

01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:01.446
I'm scared, man.

01:07:02.204 --> 01:07:06.376
I'm just tired of
lettin' everybody down.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.587
You're the only one
I can talk to.

01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:16.110
I just wish you were here.

01:08:10.735 --> 01:08:12.149
Hello, Mr. Fisk.

01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:15.290
I've got the security tapes
from the tunnel right here.

01:08:15.455 --> 01:08:18.558
If the kid's out there,
I'll find him.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.219
You know me, sir.
I don't ever quit.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.351
Personal insanity
They gotta like the ally

01:09:58.437 --> 01:09:59.429
Turn it up
Against the rally

01:09:59.515 --> 01:10:00.625
You're running in
While they're counting

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:02.950
Even score, got the tally
Knock 'em off at the finale

01:10:03.647 --> 01:10:05.784
Go, go!
They don't want it, yeah

01:10:08.612 --> 01:10:10.482
They don't want it, yeah

01:10:11.546 --> 01:10:13.052
This is

01:10:13.544 --> 01:10:15.393
Purple.
No.

01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:16.603
Blue?
No.

01:10:16.759 --> 01:10:18.309
Has anyone
heard from Miles?

01:10:18.496 --> 01:10:20.780
Look, he's just clearing his head.
I know the kid.

01:10:20.865 --> 01:10:22.395
He's got
what it takes.

01:10:22.731 --> 01:10:25.239
I bet you he's gonna come back
through that door,

01:10:25.325 --> 01:10:27.274
recharged
and ready to fight.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.865
My uncle.
Hey, where have you been?

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:31.919
My uncle Aaron, he's
he's-he's the Prowler. He

01:10:32.036 --> 01:10:33.576
Slow down, Miles. Slow down.
He works for Kingpin.

01:10:33.661 --> 01:10:34.973
He tried to kill me!

01:10:35.059 --> 01:10:37.084
This is a pretty
hard-core origin story.

01:10:37.169 --> 01:10:39.075
It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

01:10:39.161 --> 01:10:42.591
Were you followed?
No, I don't think so.

01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:54.713
Cute place. Real homey.
Oh, great. It's Liv.

01:10:54.798 --> 01:10:56.749
I guess
I was followed.

01:10:56.834 --> 01:10:57.916
Oh, no.

01:10:58.001 --> 01:10:59.317
Get out of here,
kid.

01:10:59.872 --> 01:11:03.278
You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.

01:11:03.364 --> 01:11:05.381
Speaks Spanish

01:11:06.005 --> 01:11:09.164
Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider, uh, gang.

01:11:09.312 --> 01:11:11.364
Would you mind
taking this outside?

01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.497
We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.

01:11:14.731 --> 01:11:16.692
Ooh, I think
I'll be taking that.

01:11:20.736 --> 01:11:24.075
Stand, niñito, dale.
Prepárate a morir.

01:11:25.044 --> 01:11:26.377
Man, stupid pillows.

01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:47.200
I said,
take it outside!

01:11:47.496 --> 01:11:49.152
I got it!

01:12:00.763 --> 01:12:03.934
I got this, buddy.
Leave the kid alone!

01:12:06.903 --> 01:12:08.707
No, no, no! No!

01:12:17.915 --> 01:12:19.769
You gotta go, man.

01:12:29.058 --> 01:12:31.192
All vehicles in
the area, we have a disturbance

01:12:31.277 --> 01:12:33.691
involving
multiple Spiderpeople?

01:12:33.777 --> 01:12:35.035
Yeah. On my way.

01:12:44.808 --> 01:12:46.157
Give me that thing.

01:12:46.242 --> 01:12:49.580
Don't be stupid, kid.
Hand it over, now!

01:13:07.532 --> 01:13:09.366
Nowhere left
to run.

01:13:14.771 --> 01:13:16.460
Miles?

01:13:16.901 --> 01:13:18.351
Uncle Aaron.

01:13:20.309 --> 01:13:22.976
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:30.327
Please, Uncle Aaron.

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:34.234
Prowler.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.210
What are you waitin' for?
Finish it.

01:14:04.487 --> 01:14:06.124
Get out of here!

01:14:26.943 --> 01:14:27.943
No.

01:14:28.828 --> 01:14:30.011
Miles.

01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:31.944
Uncle Aaron.

01:14:33.099 --> 01:14:34.569
This is my fault.

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:41.124
No, Miles.

01:14:42.638 --> 01:14:44.139
I'm sorry.

01:14:46.936 --> 01:14:49.124
I wanted you to look up to me.

01:14:50.416 --> 01:14:53.366
I let you down, man.
I let you down.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.624
You're the best
of all of us, Miles.

01:15:00.481 --> 01:15:02.217
You're on your way.

01:15:02.576 --> 01:15:06.686
Just
keep going.

01:15:09.483 --> 01:15:11.269
Just keep going.

01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:46.377
Hands up!

01:15:46.479 --> 01:15:48.768
Put your arms up. Now!

01:15:49.567 --> 01:15:51.698
Turn around.

01:15:54.063 --> 01:15:56.467
Hey! Hey!

01:16:03.906 --> 01:16:07.510
Aaron. Aaron, no. No!

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.401
All units.

01:16:18.823 --> 01:16:21.673
I want an APB
on a new Spider-Man.

01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:53.119
Hey, bud.

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.061
You okay?

01:17:00.034 --> 01:17:03.119
We've all been there.
You know, for me,

01:17:03.346 --> 01:17:05.080
it was my Uncle Ben.

01:17:06.068 --> 01:17:09.377
For me, it was
my Uncle Benjamin.

01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:12.124
For me,
it was my father.

01:17:12.486 --> 01:17:14.635
For me, it was
my best friend.

01:17:15.202 --> 01:17:19.049
Miles, the hardest thing
about this job is

01:17:19.805 --> 01:17:22.353
you can't always
save everybody.

01:17:23.017 --> 01:17:26.002
Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.

01:17:26.088 --> 01:17:29.525
Miles, we're probably the
only ones who do understand.

01:17:32.028 --> 01:17:34.213
Oh, no.

01:17:36.399 --> 01:17:39.003
Who in here trying
To start a riot?

01:17:40.017 --> 01:17:42.834
That way,
that way.

01:17:43.005 --> 01:17:45.476
Other way, other way,
other way, other way.

01:17:47.866 --> 01:17:49.282
Who that swinging
In the air?

01:17:49.446 --> 01:17:50.595
Hey
there.

01:17:50.695 --> 01:17:52.594
Do animals talk
in this dimension?

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.368
'Cause I don't wanna
freak him out.

01:17:55.009 --> 01:17:58.001
Let's stand up, stand up
You better just fix your

01:18:01.692 --> 01:18:03.446
What's going on?

01:18:03.693 --> 01:18:05.141
Bye,
Miles.

01:18:08.724 --> 01:18:11.008
Miles, I came
to say goodbye.

01:18:11.101 --> 01:18:12.584
We can say goodbye
at the collider.

01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:14.759
You're not getting it.
You're staying here.

01:18:14.845 --> 01:18:16.863
I need to be there.
So you can all go home.

01:18:16.949 --> 01:18:20.626
They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.

01:18:20.845 --> 01:18:23.555
You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.

01:18:23.641 --> 01:18:25.399
I'm doing
what needs to be done.

01:18:25.549 --> 01:18:27.829
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

01:18:28.487 --> 01:18:29.977
What about MJ?

01:18:30.754 --> 01:18:32.876
Not everything works out,
kid.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:35.837
I need the goober.

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.477
Please don't make me
take it from you.

01:18:38.562 --> 01:18:39.644
That's not fair!

01:18:39.729 --> 01:18:41.399
You gotta tell them
I can do this.

01:18:41.485 --> 01:18:43.407
It wasn't their decision.

01:18:46.701 --> 01:18:50.266
I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!

01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:51.791
Miles, you're gonna get
yourself killed.

01:18:51.876 --> 01:18:53.357
But I'm ready.
I promise!

01:18:56.479 --> 01:18:58.345
Then venom-strike me
right now.

01:18:58.485 --> 01:19:03.009
Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.

01:19:13.902 --> 01:19:16.965
Look, I know how
much you want this, kid.

01:19:17.058 --> 01:19:18.957
Poor
little guy.

01:19:22.738 --> 01:19:24.606
But you don't
have it yet.

01:19:30.567 --> 01:19:31.981
I'm sorry.

01:19:32.996 --> 01:19:35.166
When will I know
I'm ready?

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:39.973
You won't.
It's a leap of faith.

01:19:40.395 --> 01:19:42.090
That's all it is,
Miles.

01:19:42.238 --> 01:19:43.965
A leap of faith.

01:20:24.835 --> 01:20:26.744
Miles.

01:20:27.234 --> 01:20:29.071
Miles, it's your dad.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.069
Please open the door.

01:20:33.643 --> 01:20:36.252
Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.

01:20:38.184 --> 01:20:41.963
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.

01:20:42.423 --> 01:20:44.463
Look, can we talk
for a minute?

01:20:46.522 --> 01:20:48.197
Something

01:20:50.057 --> 01:20:52.059
Something happened to

01:20:54.919 --> 01:20:58.220
Look, sometimes
people drift apart, Miles.

01:21:00.336 --> 01:21:03.275
And I don't want that
to happen to us, okay?

01:21:04.049 --> 01:21:06.447
I know I don't always do
what you need me to do

01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:08.478
or say
what you need me to say.

01:21:10.913 --> 01:21:15.064
I see this spark in you.
It's amazing. It's why I push you.

01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:18.205
But it's yours.

01:21:18.829 --> 01:21:21.767
Whatever you choose to do
with it, you'll be great.

01:21:29.524 --> 01:21:32.080
Look, call me
when you can. Okay?

01:21:33.244 --> 01:21:34.704
I love you.

01:21:36.107 --> 01:21:38.478
You don't have to
say it back, though.

01:22:57.448 --> 01:22:59.823
200 miles per hour
With a blindfold on

01:22:59.948 --> 01:23:02.240
Mama always asking
"Where did I go wrong?"

01:23:02.355 --> 01:23:04.181
Took you long enough.
What's up, danger?

01:23:04.893 --> 01:23:06.811
Ah, what's up, danger?

01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:10.011
I see this spark in you.

01:23:10.097 --> 01:23:11.831
It's amazing.

01:23:12.302 --> 01:23:15.495
Whatever you choose to do
with it, you'll be great.

01:23:15.738 --> 01:23:17.995
Our family doesn't
run from things.

01:23:18.144 --> 01:23:21.557
You're the best of all of
us, Miles. You're on your way.

01:23:21.643 --> 01:23:23.675
Just keep going.

01:23:24.428 --> 01:23:27.612
When do I
know I'm Spider-Man?

01:23:27.901 --> 01:23:29.862
You won't.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.937
That's all it is, Miles.

01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:35.425
A leap of faith.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:39.409
Like, what's up, danger?

01:23:41.865 --> 01:23:44.235
Like, what's up, danger?

01:23:47.003 --> 01:23:48.938
Like, what's up, danger?

01:23:52.409 --> 01:23:54.558
Like, what's up, danger?

01:23:54.643 --> 01:23:56.794
Made 'em myself.

01:23:56.879 --> 01:23:58.681
They fit perfectly.

01:24:04.586 --> 01:24:06.753
Can't stop me now
Traveled 200 miles

01:24:06.839 --> 01:24:09.440
I'm knockin' at your door
And I don't really care

01:24:09.526 --> 01:24:11.012
If you ain't done wrong
I said I got you now

01:24:11.097 --> 01:24:12.550
Come on, what's up, danger?

01:24:13.252 --> 01:24:14.893
Don't be a stranger

01:24:15.073 --> 01:24:17.615
I'm right here at your door

01:24:17.701 --> 01:24:20.018
I won't leave,
I want more

01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:21.878
What's up, danger?

01:24:22.071 --> 01:24:23.554
Yeah, what's up, danger?

01:24:24.847 --> 01:24:26.073
Can't stop me now

01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:27.855
'Cause I like high G's
Sister, I might lose

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.206
I like it all on the edge
Just like you, hey

01:24:30.292 --> 01:24:32.659
I like tall buildings
So I can leap off of 'em

01:24:32.848 --> 01:24:34.815
I go hard with it
No matter how dark it is

01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:36.940
Come on, what's up, danger?

01:25:05.581 --> 01:25:07.799
Kingpin has a
private elevator entrance

01:25:07.884 --> 01:25:09.800
from his penthouse
to the collider below.

01:25:09.885 --> 01:25:11.769
Didn't count on
having an audience.

01:25:21.948 --> 01:25:23.292
You gotta be kidding me.

01:25:23.378 --> 01:25:25.768
Thank you. It's nice
to be with you this evening

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.206
to celebrate Spider-Man.

01:25:27.292 --> 01:25:29.886
He and I were very close

01:25:30.065 --> 01:25:32.955
What a pig.
I'm right here.

01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:35.826
Hold on. Get a load of how
the waiters are dressed.

01:25:35.911 --> 01:25:37.792
It's in poor taste, but

01:25:38.418 --> 01:25:40.089
It can't be
that easy.

01:25:41.049 --> 01:25:42.643
It's that easy.

01:25:47.878 --> 01:25:49.943
I just wanna
thank Mary Jane Parker

01:25:50.029 --> 01:25:51.581
for being here this evening.

01:25:52.279 --> 01:25:53.461
MJ?

01:25:55.098 --> 01:25:59.050
Pay attention.
It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?

01:25:59.306 --> 01:26:01.189
I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.

01:26:01.603 --> 01:26:03.612
Peter! Come here. Trust me.

01:26:03.698 --> 01:26:04.854
I've been there.

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:07.235
You gotta move on, buddy.
It will take one second. Let me just

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.359
Oooh!

01:26:08.445 --> 01:26:10.995
Hello.
Oh, wow.

01:26:11.145 --> 01:26:13.471
Um
I just wondered

01:26:13.557 --> 01:26:16.034
if we could have some more
bread at table 12.

01:26:16.592 --> 01:26:17.878
Yeah.

01:26:20.156 --> 01:26:22.473
I'm just
I'm really sorry.

01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:25.543
Oh! Don't be sorry.
It's just bread.

01:26:25.628 --> 01:26:28.057
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

01:26:28.143 --> 01:26:29.580
Mm-hmm.
I didn't even try.

01:26:29.665 --> 01:26:32.370
That's fine. You know,
I should really get going.

01:26:32.456 --> 01:26:34.245
I know I could do better

01:26:34.331 --> 01:26:35.848
if I just had
another chance

01:26:35.934 --> 01:26:41.167
to give you the bread
that you deserve.

01:26:41.349 --> 01:26:42.564
Are you okay?

01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:44.706
We'll take care of
that bread right now.

01:26:44.792 --> 01:26:47.064
Well, it's been nice
talking to you.

01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:49.933
For you, they should fill this
place up with fresh bread.

01:26:50.018 --> 01:26:52.637
You all right, man?
Oh, yeah. Totally.

01:26:52.722 --> 01:26:54.705
Good, 'cause we are not
getting any bread.

01:26:56.726 --> 01:26:58.509
I'm just sorry
my family can't see

01:26:58.594 --> 01:27:00.463
what we're doing here
tonight.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:11.314
Initializing
primary ignition sequence.

01:27:16.905 --> 01:27:18.274
Sleep.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.439
Start the sequence.

01:27:25.525 --> 01:27:28.471
Uploading Vanessa Fisk
and Richard Fisk DNA sequence.

01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:31.108
Beginning scan
for dimensional matches.

01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:41.744
Secondary
ignition in five, four,

01:27:41.884 --> 01:27:46.372
three, two, one.

01:28:03.026 --> 01:28:06.230
Peter, you don't have to stay
behind. I can do it.

01:28:06.316 --> 01:28:07.778
It's okay.

01:28:07.863 --> 01:28:09.582
I've made up my mind.

01:28:14.007 --> 01:28:16.490
I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.

01:28:16.576 --> 01:28:19.562
After you're gone,
I'll blow it up.

01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:21.035
Good luck, guys.

01:28:24.947 --> 01:28:26.215
They know
we're here.

01:28:33.923 --> 01:28:36.793
Nice to see you again,
Peter.

01:28:42.914 --> 01:28:44.383
I got you covered!

01:28:44.469 --> 01:28:46.404
Oh! These guys are the pits.

01:28:54.143 --> 01:28:55.539
Why is this
always difficult?

01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:57.789
Where you going, Peter?

01:28:58.537 --> 01:29:00.020
Any last words?

01:29:00.106 --> 01:29:03.008
Can I get a minute to think
about it? You have a pen?

01:29:03.251 --> 01:29:05.755
Goodbye, Peter Parker.

01:29:15.999 --> 01:29:17.549
Who did that?!

01:29:23.793 --> 01:29:26.228
Miles?
Spider-Man?

01:29:26.314 --> 01:29:29.158
Wow, Miles. You're
doing it on command!

01:29:29.244 --> 01:29:30.594
It's about time, right?

01:29:30.679 --> 01:29:33.080
Look who's here!
You figured it out.

01:29:33.166 --> 01:29:34.699
I love you!
I am so proud of you!

01:29:34.784 --> 01:29:36.752
Do I want kids?

01:29:37.613 --> 01:29:39.767
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about her.

01:29:41.424 --> 01:29:43.141
Well, that doesn't look
promising.

01:29:43.226 --> 01:29:44.814
No, it doesn't.

01:29:50.898 --> 01:29:53.502
I've got genetic matches.
Hold on.

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:54.719
It's too risky.

01:29:54.804 --> 01:29:55.892
Shut up and turn it up.

01:29:55.986 --> 01:29:57.683
On your left!
On your right!

01:29:57.768 --> 01:30:00.259
I got five o'clock!
Three o'clock! Two o'clock!

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:03.040
Every direction!

01:30:05.048 --> 01:30:07.031
Get to a shelter.
I'll be right there.

01:30:07.116 --> 01:30:08.470
Speaks Spanish

01:30:08.556 --> 01:30:10.725
I tried the school,
but I can't get through.

01:30:24.284 --> 01:30:26.202
Guys, are you seeing this?

01:30:27.937 --> 01:30:29.987
Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.

01:30:30.072 --> 01:30:32.017
Does look cool though,
right?

01:30:32.512 --> 01:30:34.448
We gotta get back
up there.

01:30:36.812 --> 01:30:37.892
Is that all you got?

01:30:37.978 --> 01:30:39.896
You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?

01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:41.759
You hard-boiled
turtle slapper!

01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:03.286
Speaks Spanish

01:31:03.462 --> 01:31:06.821
What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?

01:31:06.907 --> 01:31:09.048
You got a problem
with cartoons?

01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:16.324
Blammo!

01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:22.740
Aww

01:31:22.825 --> 01:31:25.087
Did that feel like
a cartoon?

01:31:39.142 --> 01:31:40.524
Gwen!

01:31:48.892 --> 01:31:50.008
I like your suit.

01:31:50.094 --> 01:31:51.485
Thanks. I made it myself.

01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:55.626
That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!

01:32:09.304 --> 01:32:11.789
Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.

01:32:15.478 --> 01:32:17.161
All right.
Never mind.

01:32:17.247 --> 01:32:18.477
Let's end
this thing.

01:32:18.563 --> 01:32:19.634
Guys,
I got it.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.954
I'll go. I'm the one
with the goo

01:32:22.677 --> 01:32:23.961
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

01:32:24.273 --> 01:32:26.876
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

01:32:32.161 --> 01:32:33.330
Miles!
Be careful!

01:32:47.076 --> 01:32:48.259
That was crazy.

01:32:48.344 --> 01:32:50.193
We taught him that,
right?

01:32:50.278 --> 01:32:53.049
I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.

01:33:10.965 --> 01:33:12.340
You okay?

01:33:13.883 --> 01:33:15.285
Come on.

01:33:22.144 --> 01:33:24.896
Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!

01:33:26.379 --> 01:33:29.801
Alert! Quantum
polarity has been reversed.

01:33:35.039 --> 01:33:36.566
Guess
this is it.

01:33:36.690 --> 01:33:40.660
Well, nice to know
we're not alone.

01:33:40.801 --> 01:33:43.160
Right?
Yeah.

01:33:43.458 --> 01:33:46.347
I got the portal open.
You first, Peni.

01:33:46.535 --> 01:33:48.144
Thank you,
Miles.

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.426
From both
of us.

01:33:53.613 --> 01:33:56.799
I, uh, love you all.

01:33:57.363 --> 01:33:59.816
I'm taking this cube thing
with me.

01:34:00.054 --> 01:34:01.840
I don't understand it.

01:34:02.147 --> 01:34:03.782
But I will.

01:34:07.572 --> 01:34:09.394
I want you
to have this.

01:34:09.551 --> 01:34:11.308
It'll fit
in your pocket.

01:34:12.552 --> 01:34:14.371
That's all, folks.

01:34:14.636 --> 01:34:17.152
Is he allowed
to say that, legally?

01:34:20.949 --> 01:34:22.966
Do I get to like
the hairdo now?

01:34:24.574 --> 01:34:26.257
You know I'm older than you.

01:34:26.465 --> 01:34:29.676
15 months, but it's pretty
significant if you ask me.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.397
Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:35.970
Nice.

01:34:38.653 --> 01:34:40.152
Friends?

01:34:41.656 --> 01:34:42.972
Friends.

01:34:43.192 --> 01:34:44.394
Cool.

01:34:44.496 --> 01:34:46.210
See you around,
Spider-Man.

01:34:57.167 --> 01:34:58.543
Your turn.

01:34:59.387 --> 01:35:02.257
Yeah, yeah. Right.

01:35:05.769 --> 01:35:07.902
You're not going anywhere!

01:35:08.457 --> 01:35:10.500
I'll hold him off.
You shut this down.

01:35:10.585 --> 01:35:12.082
Peter,
that wasn't the deal!

01:35:12.168 --> 01:35:15.652
Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!

01:35:19.285 --> 01:35:21.678
What are you doing?
You gotta go home!

01:35:21.763 --> 01:35:24.722
This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.

01:35:24.808 --> 01:35:26.168
Neither can I.

01:35:28.637 --> 01:35:30.386
It's okay.

01:35:30.786 --> 01:35:32.636
Yeah, it is okay.

01:35:36.679 --> 01:35:38.855
You gotta go home, man.

01:35:40.648 --> 01:35:43.082
How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?

01:35:43.306 --> 01:35:44.785
You won't.

01:35:45.837 --> 01:35:47.219
Right.

01:35:47.484 --> 01:35:49.363
It's a leap of faith.

01:35:58.475 --> 01:36:00.433
Not bad, kid.

01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:11.465
Kingpin!

01:36:24.626 --> 01:36:25.742
Nope!

01:36:25.827 --> 01:36:28.063
Sorry! That's cheating.

01:36:30.299 --> 01:36:31.585
Adiós.

01:36:39.674 --> 01:36:41.677
I gotta get to that button.

01:36:46.549 --> 01:36:47.974
Oh, no.

01:36:48.089 --> 01:36:51.005
Not so easy doing it
on your own, is it?

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:56.705
I can't wait to kill
one more Spider-Man.

01:36:59.888 --> 01:37:01.935
Where am I?
What?

01:37:02.043 --> 01:37:03.473
Wilson?

01:37:03.644 --> 01:37:06.718
Is this what you want, man?
What are you doing?

01:37:06.804 --> 01:37:09.186
Vanessa. Vanessa.

01:37:09.272 --> 01:37:11.435
What are we doing here?
I don't know, Richard.

01:37:11.521 --> 01:37:13.599
It's me. You know me.

01:37:14.101 --> 01:37:15.786
We're leaving now.

01:37:16.021 --> 01:37:17.528
Don't go.

01:37:18.147 --> 01:37:19.530
Stay with me.

01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:21.208
Please!

01:37:26.402 --> 01:37:29.489
You're not stopping this.
Not today.

01:37:29.630 --> 01:37:32.391
I am stopping this.
Right now!

01:37:40.112 --> 01:37:42.349
I need backup.

01:38:19.845 --> 01:38:21.251
Come on.

01:38:29.511 --> 01:38:32.570
The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.

01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:36.820
You're nothing!

01:38:42.531 --> 01:38:44.767
You took my family.

01:38:48.603 --> 01:38:52.708
And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.

01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:14.421
Get up, Spider-Man.

01:39:16.431 --> 01:39:18.945
Get up! Come on!

01:39:25.811 --> 01:39:29.234
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:39:40.302 --> 01:39:42.491
I'll always have my family.

01:39:43.482 --> 01:39:45.741
You ever hear of
the shoulder touch?

01:39:46.326 --> 01:39:47.726
What?

01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:52.743
Hey.

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:06.902
Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:58.477
Miles? Miles? Miles?
A-A-A-Are you okay?

01:41:58.626 --> 01:42:00.158
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:42:00.617 --> 01:42:01.878
You're probably busy,
so

01:42:01.964 --> 01:42:04.377
No, no no! I can talk,
I can talk.

01:42:04.735 --> 01:42:07.885
Look, so I came by earlier
because, uh

01:42:09.016 --> 01:42:11.025
Your uncle
I know, Dad.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.173
I am so sorry.

01:42:14.259 --> 01:42:15.634
Yeah.

01:42:16.478 --> 01:42:17.861
Do you know
who did it?

01:42:17.946 --> 01:42:19.353
I thought I did.

01:42:19.439 --> 01:42:21.489
But I was wrong.

01:42:21.916 --> 01:42:25.103
Look, Miles,
what I said at the door,

01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:26.884
it wasn't just talk.

01:42:28.677 --> 01:42:30.761
Look, you know,
I was thinking

01:42:30.854 --> 01:42:33.473
maybe we could find
a nice wall,

01:42:33.605 --> 01:42:34.980
privately owned,
Okay, dad.

01:42:35.066 --> 01:42:36.892
Like at the police station,
Okay.

01:42:36.978 --> 01:42:42.345
And you could "throw up"
some of your art.

01:42:42.962 --> 01:42:44.759
Man, I'm bad at this.

01:42:45.072 --> 01:42:48.267
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

01:42:49.141 --> 01:42:51.494
Oh, come on, man.
C-Mobile!

01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:53.580
Officer.
Spider-Man!

01:42:54.005 --> 01:42:56.611
Listen, down there,
that was

01:42:56.784 --> 01:42:58.433
I I mean, I owe you

01:42:58.519 --> 01:43:00.723
Ooo-kay!

01:43:08.168 --> 01:43:10.006
I look
forward to workin' with you.

01:43:10.091 --> 01:43:12.877
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, me, too. I guess.

01:43:12.963 --> 01:43:14.854
I-I-I don't approve of
your methods,

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:19.104
but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.

01:43:19.571 --> 01:43:22.104
Thank you for
your bravery tonight.

01:43:22.643 --> 01:43:23.924
I love you.

01:43:24.010 --> 01:43:25.112
Wait, what?

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.529
And look behind you!

01:43:38.431 --> 01:43:40.315
All right. Cool. Yeah.

01:43:40.401 --> 01:43:42.065
Thanks, Spider-Man.
Spider-Man, a su servicio.

01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:42.838
Thank you.

01:43:42.924 --> 01:43:44.776
Hey, man. What's up,
little man?

01:43:44.862 --> 01:43:45.721
New Spider-Man.

01:43:45.807 --> 01:43:47.049
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm the new Spider-Man.

01:43:47.134 --> 01:43:48.416
Check it out.

01:43:48.547 --> 01:43:49.795
Whoa!

01:43:49.902 --> 01:43:51.971
That was part of the move.

01:43:53.119 --> 01:43:55.588
Okay, let's do
this one last time, yeah?

01:43:55.674 --> 01:43:57.190
For real this time. This is it.

01:43:57.315 --> 01:43:58.861
My name is Miles Morales.

01:43:58.946 --> 01:44:01.065
I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.

01:44:01.151 --> 01:44:02.510
And for like two days,

01:44:02.596 --> 01:44:04.627
I've been
the one and only Spider-Man.

01:44:04.877 --> 01:44:06.233
I think you know the rest.

01:44:06.319 --> 01:44:07.932
I finished my essay.

01:44:08.235 --> 01:44:10.143
Saved a bunch of people.

01:44:12.103 --> 01:44:14.200
Got hit by a drone.

01:44:14.286 --> 01:44:16.401
I did this with my dad.

01:44:17.127 --> 01:44:19.398
Met my roommate. Finally.

01:44:21.236 --> 01:44:24.409
Slapped a sticker where
my dad's never gonna find it.

01:44:24.909 --> 01:44:26.471
And when I feel alone,

01:44:26.557 --> 01:44:29.268
like no one understands
what I'm going through,

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.276
I remember my friends
who get it.

01:44:39.166 --> 01:44:41.671
I never thought I'd be able
to do any of this stuff.

01:44:41.756 --> 01:44:43.534
But I can.

01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:46.830
Anyone can wear the mask.

01:44:48.095 --> 01:44:50.510
You could wear the mask.

01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:55.252
If you didn't know that before,
I hope you do now.

01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:05.518
'Cause I'm Spider-Man.

01:45:07.005 --> 01:45:09.628
And I'm not the only one.

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:10.908
Not by a long shot.

01:45:10.988 --> 01:45:13.443
Needless to say
I keep her in check

01:45:13.528 --> 01:45:16.058
She was all bad-bad
Nevertheless

01:45:16.167 --> 01:45:18.782
Callin' it quits now
Baby, I'm a wreck

01:45:18.867 --> 01:45:22.085
Miles. Miles!

01:45:22.248 --> 01:45:23.730
You got a minute?

01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:35.207
Stepped out of my zone
My zone

01:45:35.292 --> 01:45:37.090
I had to get out all alone
All alone

01:45:37.175 --> 01:45:38.792
And figure it out on my own
My own

01:45:38.877 --> 01:45:40.870
And I know what
I really want now

01:45:40.956 --> 01:45:42.572
Can't stop me
Can't break me

01:45:42.657 --> 01:45:44.207
What don't kill me
Gon' make me

01:45:44.292 --> 01:45:46.198
Shoot for the stars
No safety

01:45:46.284 --> 01:45:47.855
And now I see clear in HD

01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:49.746
Gotta go hard
Gotta go hard

01:45:49.831 --> 01:45:51.581
I ain't got time to waste
I ain't got time

01:45:51.666 --> 01:45:53.378
I gotta go high
Gotta go high

01:45:53.464 --> 01:45:55.423
I gotta elevate
I gotta elevate

01:45:55.509 --> 01:45:57.135
They wanna fight
They wanna fight

01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:59.148

01:54:50.937 --> 01:54:53.155
Oh, Spidey-bells
Might be swell

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.735
To do more than fight crime

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:57.946
I got a lot of qualities
That don't get much airtime

01:54:58.321 --> 01:55:00.820
I can sing, I can dance
I tell jokes, I act

01:55:00.906 --> 01:55:02.914
I get big, big,
big deal

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.618
If my agent called me back

01:55:06.594 --> 01:55:10.480
Why did I agree

01:55:10.689 --> 01:55:15.235
To do this stupid song?

01:55:15.391 --> 01:55:18.242
I have a degree

01:55:18.365 --> 01:55:22.922
In chemical engineering

01:55:32.328 --> 01:55:33.305
You're a bit late.

01:55:33.391 --> 01:55:34.626
We can't all be
everywhere at once.

01:55:34.711 --> 01:55:35.884
Little text
might've been nice.

01:55:35.969 --> 01:55:37.947
I was gone for less than two hours.
What happened?

01:55:38.032 --> 01:55:40.015
Okay. Okay.
I know what it looks like.

01:55:40.101 --> 01:55:42.486
But here's the good news.
Oh, here we go.

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:44.617
The multiverse didn't collapse.

01:55:44.703 --> 01:55:46.421
Oh, cool!
Little touch and go.

01:55:46.507 --> 01:55:47.515
But it worked out.

01:55:47.601 --> 01:55:49.141
Great story. Did
you finish the goober?

01:55:49.226 --> 01:55:50.554
It's not a goober.
It's a gizmo.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.822
Do you always
have to call me out?

01:55:51.907 --> 01:55:53.153
It's just really frustrating
and bums me out.

01:55:53.238 --> 01:55:54.489
Don't get excited, Miguel.

01:55:54.574 --> 01:55:55.998
It's just a prototype.
Not excited.

01:55:56.083 --> 01:55:57.579
But you could
be the first person

01:55:57.625 --> 01:55:59.508
to make an autonomous
multiverse jump.

01:55:59.638 --> 01:56:00.638
Or the last.

01:56:00.726 --> 01:56:02.476
Okay. So we're just gonna roll
the dice on this?

01:56:02.524 --> 01:56:05.308
So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?

01:56:05.645 --> 01:56:08.497
Let's start at the beginning
one last time.

01:56:08.664 --> 01:56:10.563
Earth '67.

01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.719
Whoa!
What the?

01:56:14.805 --> 01:56:15.938
I'm Spider-Man.

01:56:16.024 --> 01:56:17.634
I need you to come with me.
Who the heck are you?

01:56:17.719 --> 01:56:20.398
I-I just told you
Listen. Listen I'm from the future.

01:56:20.484 --> 01:56:22.750
How dare you point at me!
You were pointing first.

01:56:22.836 --> 01:56:24.570
It's rude to point.
You're being very rude.

01:56:24.655 --> 01:56:27.181
You're not believing I'm not
Which one pointed first?

01:56:27.267 --> 01:56:28.875
Spider-Man pointed first.
Obviously.

01:56:28.961 --> 01:56:30.500
You're pointing at me right now.
I'm not pointing.

01:56:30.585 --> 01:56:31.453
What you say? Look at you
You're pointing.

01:56:31.539 --> 01:56:32.703
Look at your finger. Look at.
I'm just Pointing at

01:56:32.788 --> 01:56:33.977
your finger right now.
Which is different. Then normal

01:56:34.062 --> 01:56:35.305
You're pointing
pointing. You haven't seen.

01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:36.225
You're accusing me.
Pointing

01:56:36.318 --> 01:56:38.264
of pointing while you're
at you. Then No.
