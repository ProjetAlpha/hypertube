The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

00:40:28.009 --> 00:40:29.852
the gateway will come.

00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:34.603
And stop.

00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:37.310

You cannot beat a river into submission.

00:41:09.717 --> 00:41:11.640
You have to surrender to its current...

00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:14.056
and use its power as your own.

00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:16.395
I control it by surrendering control?

but not because you craved success...

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:10.262

01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:49.014
I've come to bargain.

01:38:49.173 --> 01:38:50.174
DORMAMMU: End this!

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:53.053

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:12.281
DORMAMMU: You will never win.

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:14.699
(PANTING) No...

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:16.876
but I can lose...

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:20.330
again and again...

01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.085
and again...

01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:24.876
and again, forever.

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:27.879
And that makes you my prisoner.

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:29.297
No!

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.620
- (DOCTOR STRANGE YELPS)
- Stop!

01:39:31.174 --> 01:39:33.597
Make this stop!

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:35.887
Set me free!

01:39:36.888 --> 01:39:37.889
No.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:40.357
I've come to bargain.

01:39:42.018 --> 01:39:44.396
What do you want?

01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:48.237
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:50.902
End your assault on my world.

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:52.949
Never come back.

01:39:53.404 --> 01:39:54.530
Do it...

01:39:55.114 --> 01:39:57.287
and I'll break the loop.

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:06.758
(GROANING)

01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:07.923
Get up, Strange!

01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:09.337
Get up and fight.

01:40:09.962 --> 01:40:11.555
We can finish this.

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:13.289
KAECILIUS: Isn't it beautiful?

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:17.937
A world beyond time.

01:40:20.556 --> 01:40:22.103
Beyond death.

01:40:33.945 --> 01:40:35.288
What have you done?

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:36.993

Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:48.130
Eternal life as part of the One.

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:52.505

Yeah, you know, you really should have

01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:16.742
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:19.074
The warnings come after the spells.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:59.030
We did it.

01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:03.038
Yes. (SCOFFS)

01:42:03.826 --> 01:42:05.544
Yes, we did it.

01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:07.959
By also violating...

01:42:08.205 --> 01:42:09.707
the natural law.

01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:13.215
Look around you. It's over.

01:42:13.461 --> 01:42:16.180
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:19.305
No price to pay?

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:22.888
We broke our rules, just like her.

01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:27.358
The bill comes due.

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:29.151
Always!

01:42:30.394 --> 01:42:31.566
A reckoning.

01:42:34.649 --> 01:42:37.493

once you've mastered its powers.

01:43:28.786 --> 01:43:29.958
Until then...

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.708
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

01:43:33.791 --> 01:43:34.838
A what?

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:38.304
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

01:43:38.379 --> 01:43:40.222
but you still have much to learn.

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:45.345
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:47.977
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

01:43:48.472 --> 01:43:49.473
We must be ready.

Not tea.

01:46:52.781 --> 01:46:54.328
So, I keep a watch list...

01:46:54.575 --> 01:46:56.327
of individuals and beings
from other realms

01:46:56.452 --> 01:46:57.852
that may be a threat to this world.

Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

01:47:04.001 --> 01:47:05.674
Worthy inclusion.

01:47:05.753 --> 01:47:06.925
Yeah.

01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:12.101
So why bring him here to New York?

01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:13.769
It's a bit of a long story.

01:47:13.844 --> 01:47:15.846
Family drama, that kind of thing.

01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:17.682
But we're looking for my father.

Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...

01:47:21.477 --> 01:47:24.526
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

Oh, yes. Promptly.

MORDO: I've been away
for many months now,

01:53:49.781 --> 01:53:51.533
and I've had a revelation.

01:53:52.409 --> 01:53:54.958
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

01:53:55.245 --> 01:53:57.873
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:00.292

I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

- Mine.
- Power...
