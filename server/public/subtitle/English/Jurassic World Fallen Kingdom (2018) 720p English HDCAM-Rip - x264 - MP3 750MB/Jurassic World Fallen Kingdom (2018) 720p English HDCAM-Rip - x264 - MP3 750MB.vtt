00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:43.099
Isla Nublar
193 miles west of Costa Rica

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.115
Relax.

00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:10.677
Anything in here would
be dead by now.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.058
There she is.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.941
The Indominus Rex.

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.959
- Specimen collected, sent to the surface.
- Roger that.

00:03:18.984 --> 00:03:22.397
- Air One, clear for takeoff. Begin tracking.
- Copy that.

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:24.882
- Go, go.
- Tracking on.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:39.011
Land One, the asset is secure.
We got what we came for.

00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:41.222
Coming back for you.
Close the doors.

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:44.253
Marine One, I gotta close the gate.
Get outta there.

00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:46.925
Understood. We're heading out.

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.886
Marine One, I need to close the gate.
Confirm position.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.198
- Can you hear me, are you out?
- Marine One?

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.018
Guys, what is that?

00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:22.071
Marine One, I am
closing the gates.

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:28.548
Seriously guys, I'm kind
of exposed out here.

00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:31.407
Marine One, confirm you're out.
Marine One!

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:35.080
Confirm position. Can you hear me?
Marine One, where are you?

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.418
I can't reach them!

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.067
What?!

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:49.848
What is going on?
I can't hear you.

00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:10.501
Throw him the ladder!

00:05:14.853 --> 00:05:16.813
Don't go!

00:05:41.377 --> 00:05:44.416
We're gonna stall! Cut it now!

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:47.423
- Do it, John!
- We're gonna die here!

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.034
I said cut it!

00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:34.372
DNA sample secure. Tell the
boss we're coming back home.

00:07:04.094 --> 00:07:06.250
Three years after the
fall of Jurassic World,

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:09.289
the debate over Isla
Nublar rages on.

00:07:09.383 --> 00:07:13.164
The island's long dormant
volcano, reclassified as active,

00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:16.281
has shown considerable
unrest in recent months.

00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:19.070
Theologists now predict
an extinction level event

00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:22.578
will kill off the last living
dinosaurs on the planet.

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:25.554
Since the disaster that
shocked the world in 2015,

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:28.859
the Masrani Corporation has
paid out more than $800 million

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:32.789
in damages to settle class action
lawsuits brought by survivors.

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:35.718
Activist groups have
mobilized around the globe,

00:07:35.734 --> 00:07:39.835
in what has become the flashpoint
animal rights issue of our time.

00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:42.343
With an eruption
expected at any moment,

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:45.109
the US Senate has convened
a special committee,

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:47.523
to answer a grave
moral question:

00:07:47.563 --> 00:07:50.257
Do dinosaurs deserve
the same protections

00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:52.234
given to other
endangered species,

00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.820
or should they be left to die?

00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:56.298
I think...

00:07:56.323 --> 00:07:58.971
that we should allow our...

00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:01.924
magnificent, glorious dinosaurs,

00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:05.283
to be taken out by the volcano.

00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:11.165
- Silence, please.
- As deeply sad as that would be.

00:08:11.947 --> 00:08:14.361
We altered the course
of natural history.

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:16.790
This is the correction.

00:08:16.806 --> 00:08:19.032
Are you suggesting
the Almighty is

00:08:19.049 --> 00:08:21.064
taking matters in His own hands?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.994
Senator, with all due
respect, God's not...

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:25.025
part of the equation. No.

00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:28.431
What I mean is that, in the
last century, we amassed

00:08:28.447 --> 00:08:31.119
a landmark technological power.

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:35.556
And we've consistently proven ourselves
incapable of handling that power.

00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:38.486
80 years ago, who could've
predicted nuclear proliferation?

00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:39.440
But then, there it was.

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:41.417
And now, we've got genetic power.
So...

00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:44.503
How long is it gonna take for
that to spread around the globe

00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.182
and, what's gonna
be done with it?

00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:50.909
It ain't gonna stop with the
de-extinction of the dinosaurs.

00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:53.800
I'm not sure I know what
you're talking about.

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:55.557
I'm talking about...

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:58.612
man-made, cataclysmic,

00:08:58.932 --> 00:09:00.440
change.

00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:02.658
What kind of change?

00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:04.993
Change is like death.

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:09.743
You don't know what it looks like
until you're standing at the gates.

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:33.708
As a matter of fact, I do have the
dinosaurs' best interests in mind.

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:36.295
- I'm a paleo-veterinarian.
- Is that a real thing?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.990
- That's a real thing.
- You've seen one?

00:09:37.998 --> 00:09:39.841
No! I hadn't seen one with my own eyes.
you know not

00:09:39.866 --> 00:09:43.139
everyone can afford to spend
their life savings... Claire?

00:09:45.858 --> 00:09:48.116
Hello, hello, um...

00:09:48.912 --> 00:09:52.678
Congresswoman Delgado. I'm Claire,
the lead organizer in here.

00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:55.974
Of course, but if I can just
get a moment of your time?

00:09:57.077 --> 00:09:59.107
Great. Thank you.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.381
So, our mission here at the
Dinosaur Protection Group is

00:10:02.405 --> 00:10:05.029
to secure pivotal
funding for a...

00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:07.061
That was like 40 seconds.
You're getting better.

00:10:07.077 --> 00:10:08.951
You gotta stop letting
your mom shop for you.

00:10:08.968 --> 00:10:11.445
You don't need to insult me
everytime someone pisses you off.

00:10:11.456 --> 00:10:14.275
Dude. I'm a doctor.
Not a telemarketer.

00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:17.252
What is your job again?
You plug in cords, right?

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.025
It's actually more
important than it sounds.

00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:21.432
Can I ask you a question?

00:10:21.581 --> 00:10:23.033
Do you have kids?

00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:24.877
Okay. So your kids.

00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:27.400
An entire generation has
grown up in a world

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:30.049
where dinosaurs are
living and breathing.

00:10:30.409 --> 00:10:32.979
But soon you're gonna have
to watch them go extinct.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.307
Or not.

00:10:34.822 --> 00:10:36.893
If people like you
make a difference.

00:10:40.157 --> 00:10:41.157
Great.

00:10:42.696 --> 00:10:44.047
Yes!

00:10:46.571 --> 00:10:49.344
- Claire, it's on.
- Hey, hey. Turn it up.

00:10:49.868 --> 00:10:53.719
...take preventative action to protect
the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar.

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:55.578
After thorough deliberations,

00:10:55.603 --> 00:10:59.267
the committee has resolved not to
recommend any legislative action

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:03.159
regarding the de-extinct
creatures on Isla Nublar.

00:11:03.472 --> 00:11:05.581
This is an act of God, and

00:11:05.589 --> 00:11:08.612
while of course, we feel great
sympathy for these animals,

00:11:08.644 --> 00:11:10.854
we cannot condone
government involvement,

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:14.354
on what amounts to a
privately-owned venture.

00:11:18.275 --> 00:11:21.032
They're all gonna die
and no one cares.

00:11:22.283 --> 00:11:23.571
We do.

00:11:28.427 --> 00:11:31.177
Give me one second.
Let's get back to work.

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.403
Okay everyone. Come on.

00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:39.469
- Hello?
- May I speak with Ms. Dearing?

00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:41.524
- Yes, this is Claire Dearing.
- Good morning.

00:11:41.548 --> 00:11:45.415
I'm calling for Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's
estate. Would you mind holding for a second?

00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:48.329
Yes, of course. I'll hold.

00:11:52.823 --> 00:11:57.121
Lockwood Estate
California

00:12:15.498 --> 00:12:17.404
Ms. Dearing, you're early.

00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:19.966
- Would you like to step in?
- Thank you.

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:24.427
I will inform Mr. Mills
that you've arrived.

00:12:47.174 --> 00:12:48.745
John Alfred Hammond.

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:50.401
The father of Jurassic Park.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.901
But of course, you know that.

00:12:51.956 --> 00:12:54.721
Hello, Claire, I'm, I'm Eli.
Mills.

00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:58.104
I work for Ben Lockwood. We
actually met once, 7-8 years ago,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.331
- and you don't remember...
- Of course, I remember.

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:02.721
- Haven't you run his foundations since...
- Since college. Yeah.

00:13:02.737 --> 00:13:03.916
- You remember?
- Yes!

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.807
Wow, cool. He wanted
someone young, and,

00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:09.323
idealistic to expand his fortune.

00:13:09.737 --> 00:13:11.510
And I used to be both.

00:13:12.628 --> 00:13:14.033
Follow me.

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:17.487
Let me give you a
bit of history.

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:18.995
This is where it all began.

00:13:19.034 --> 00:13:22.291
Before the islands, Sorna,
Jurassic Park, all of it.

00:13:22.393 --> 00:13:25.768
Hammond and Lockwood built
custom lab in a sub-basement

00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:28.115
extracted the first
DNA from amber,

00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:29.936
right beneath our feet.

00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:34.029
My goodness! What they
did here was a miracle.

00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:37.762
- I still believe that.
- So do I, Claire.

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:40.216
So do I, and I still believe

00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:42.842
it matters, what happens
to those animals.

00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:47.195
There is something Mr. Lockwood would
very much like you to do, Claire.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.782
You can call it a favor
for an old friend.

00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:52.852
We have, a piece of land.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.243
A sanctuary. Protected
by natural barriers,

00:13:56.259 --> 00:14:00.993
fully self-sustaining. A new home
where the dinosaurs will be secure...

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:03.446
- And free.
- You're gonna get them out?

00:14:03.486 --> 00:14:06.587
- You're gonna save them?
- No, Ms. Dearing.

00:14:06.697 --> 00:14:08.665
I'm going to save us.

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:11.837
We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?

00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:15.907
- Lovely to see you again.
- And you, Mr. Lockwood.

00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:19.719
This was all John
Hammond's dream.

00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:22.532
To let these creatures
live in peace.

00:14:22.775 --> 00:14:26.235
So, we have created sanctuary.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.181
No fences, no
cages, no tourists.

00:14:30.384 --> 00:14:32.595
Just as Mother Nature intended.

00:14:33.025 --> 00:14:34.939
John said it best.

00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:38.634
"These creatures don't
need our protection."

00:14:38.852 --> 00:14:41.431
"They need our absence."

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.100
When we were young,

00:14:45.382 --> 00:14:48.483
we both shared this
passion, John and I.

00:14:49.717 --> 00:14:51.451
What fools we were.

00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:56.005
Trying to run before
we'd learn to walk.

00:14:56.326 --> 00:14:58.841
As all young men do, I suppose.

00:15:00.342 --> 00:15:02.732
But, we learned.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.388
Unfortunately in the
end, it drove us apart.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.466
Life, teaches us some
very hard lessons...

00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:14.130
Doesn't it, Claire?

00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:16.020
Yes.

00:15:16.285 --> 00:15:17.480
Sir Benjamin.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.418
Hmm?

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.738
My bloody medicines.

00:15:21.871 --> 00:15:24.527
- Would you excuse me, Claire?
- Of course, sir.

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:27.574
Eli here willl help
you with the details.

00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:30.386
We will save them.

00:15:31.488 --> 00:15:33.433
With a gift...

00:15:35.207 --> 00:15:36.902
For our children.

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:38.674
Thank you.

00:15:39.448 --> 00:15:40.487
Iris?

00:15:45.364 --> 00:15:47.622
Does he have children? I thought I saw...
there was a little girl.

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:49.443
Yeah, he has a grandchild.

00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:52.348
His daughter died
in a car accident.

00:15:52.373 --> 00:15:55.232
- That's awful.
- Yeah, I know. But they're very close.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.755
Really close.

00:15:57.951 --> 00:15:59.708
So, what do you need from me?

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.724
There was a tracking system
in place at the park.

00:16:02.747 --> 00:16:05.684
- Radio frequency ID chips in each dinosaur.
- I remember.

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:07.864
Right, so if we could
access that system,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.434
our ability to locate and capture those
animals safely, will increase ten-fold.

00:16:12.457 --> 00:16:14.996
We need your handprint
to access the system.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.589
But what I really
need, Claire...

00:16:18.973 --> 00:16:19.925
...is you.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.606
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.528
But it's the right thing to do. No one
knows this park as well as you do

00:16:25.544 --> 00:16:27.543
and we need that expertise.

00:16:28.505 --> 00:16:30.786
- How many can you save?
- Eleven species. For sure,

00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:34.975
I mean, more, if we can. But
time is against us I'm afraid.

00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:38.232
There is one animal,
in particular

00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:40.857
that poses a real
challenge for us.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.068
- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name. But Blue,

00:16:44.092 --> 00:16:47.216
is potentially the second most intelligent
piece of life on this planet.

00:16:47.232 --> 00:16:48.716
And she's the last of her kind.

00:16:48.787 --> 00:16:50.177
She must be preserved.

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:53.732
She can pick up your scent a mile off.
You will never capture her.

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:54.826
Well...

00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:58.591
We thought you might know
someone who could help.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.427
Maybe you can convince him.

00:17:41.716 --> 00:17:43.426
Hey, Owen.

00:17:47.286 --> 00:17:48.746
Owen!

00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:50.668
Oh, boy.

00:17:57.891 --> 00:17:58.891
Hi.

00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:02.048
Back for more, huh?

00:18:02.595 --> 00:18:04.259
Can I buy you a beer?

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:07.985
You mean bring 'em, or we
gonna like, go somewhere?

00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:17.944
Seriously?

00:18:18.085 --> 00:18:20.397
I can't believe you
think that you left me!

00:18:20.428 --> 00:18:22.701
Replay that conversation in
your head, all right? You said,

00:18:22.717 --> 00:18:25.084
"You wanna go live in
your van like a bum?"

00:18:25.116 --> 00:18:28.537
"Go ahead, Owen."
And I said, "Okay!"

00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:30.834
- So how is that you leaving me?
- Because I left.

00:18:30.866 --> 00:18:33.616
- I left you.
- You left, because...

00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:36.990
- I told you to.
- And then, I left.

00:18:37.061 --> 00:18:39.599
Because you didn't wanna live in
a van on the side of the road.

00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:42.677
No, no, no. Because you wouldn't
let me drive the damn van,

00:18:42.701 --> 00:18:45.084
- for 5 minutes.
- I'm chivalrous. What can I do?

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.302
- You are so stubborn.
- Well. Look at you now.

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:49.646
- You're saving the world.
- Well, I'm trying, at least.

00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:51.997
You can't just run away
from everything, Owen.

00:18:52.028 --> 00:18:53.403
So, you're what?

00:18:53.528 --> 00:18:55.426
Dating an accountant now?

00:18:55.466 --> 00:18:57.989
An insurance actuary?

00:18:58.145 --> 00:18:59.973
Your skin looks nice.

00:19:02.051 --> 00:19:04.355
- Dermatologist?
- Owen?

00:19:04.385 --> 00:19:06.088
- Does he check you for moles?
- Stop.

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.112
Ventriloquist?

00:19:07.137 --> 00:19:10.535
- This is not why we're here, okay?
- Yeah, I know why we're here.

00:19:11.145 --> 00:19:13.387
Lockwood's little
flunkie called me.

00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:14.637
Rescue op.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:17.832
Save the dinosaurs from an
island that's about to explode.

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:19.505
- What could go wrong?
- I'm going.

00:19:19.542 --> 00:19:21.317
- Don't!
- I don't have a choice.

00:19:21.342 --> 00:19:24.106
- What, of course you have a choice.
- So what, I should just...

00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:26.677
Build my own cabin, play
pool and drink beer all day

00:19:26.694 --> 00:19:28.982
while these dinosaurs
go extinct?

00:19:29.006 --> 00:19:31.631
Yeah. I like pool.

00:19:32.154 --> 00:19:34.091
Blue is alive.

00:19:35.334 --> 00:19:38.177
- Jesus, Claire.
- You raised her, Owen. You...

00:19:38.225 --> 00:19:40.959
You spent years of your
life working with her.

00:19:41.287 --> 00:19:43.443
You're just gonna let her die?

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.587
Well, yeah.

00:19:49.634 --> 00:19:51.735
Come on. You're a
better man than...

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:53.595
you think you are.

00:19:54.658 --> 00:19:57.142
You should write for
fortune cookies.

00:19:58.877 --> 00:20:00.150
Forget it. I...

00:20:00.713 --> 00:20:03.080
There's a chartered flight
leaving tomorrow morning.

00:20:03.104 --> 00:20:06.080
You're on the manifest. I just
thought I should let you know.

00:20:25.544 --> 00:20:27.301
Back up! Back off.

00:20:29.653 --> 00:20:32.223
Take it easy. Echo.

00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.129
Jeez. There's plenty of food.

00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:39.543
You guys been eating sugar or something?
You're hyper today.

00:20:41.015 --> 00:20:44.866
Okay, okay, back off.
Thank you, Blue.

00:20:54.357 --> 00:20:56.302
Did you get that?

00:21:04.324 --> 00:21:05.324
Relax.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:08.167
You're more likely to die riding
a horse than in a plane.

00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:11.237
No, I would not because I wouldn't
get on a horse. My chances are zero.

00:21:11.262 --> 00:21:13.519
- Planes are the safest way to travel.
- You call this a plane?

00:21:13.544 --> 00:21:15.942
My cousin had a drone
bigger than this.

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:25.106
Owen!

00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:27.208
Franklin, later!
Get in the plane.

00:21:27.233 --> 00:21:29.529
Didn't think you were
gonna ever show up.

00:21:30.303 --> 00:21:32.623
- This is Zia Rodriguez.
- Zia.

00:21:32.648 --> 00:21:34.601
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:36.671
- Good.
- Franklin Webb.

00:21:36.687 --> 00:21:38.601
Systems analyst.

00:21:39.991 --> 00:21:41.273
Nervous flyer?

00:21:41.296 --> 00:21:44.038
Would you ride a thousand pound
horse with big wheels on the sides?

00:21:44.063 --> 00:21:47.124
I rode a motorcycle through the
jungle with a pack of raptors.

00:21:47.898 --> 00:21:49.858
We're not compatible.

00:22:02.868 --> 00:22:04.150
Maisie!

00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.050
Maisie.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.847
Maisie!

00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:19.730
Come out.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.751
You silly sausage!

00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:37.125
You'll be the death of me.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.476
You know one day, my
heart might really stop.

00:22:39.783 --> 00:22:41.158
Then what would you do?

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.134
- Go live in the forest with the lions?
- There are no lions in the forest.

00:22:44.182 --> 00:22:45.674
Your grandfather's
been asking for you.

00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:46.549
Really?

00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:49.025
So you go see your grandfather and
you go straight to your bath.

00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:50.986
- I don't want a bath.
- What?!

00:22:51.112 --> 00:22:53.127
Queen's English, girl. Bath.

00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:54.643
- Bath. Bath.
- Bath. Bath.

00:22:54.668 --> 00:22:57.699
Not bath. You're
not a wild animal.

00:22:58.034 --> 00:22:59.034
Stop.

00:23:04.124 --> 00:23:06.506
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Ah, there you are.

00:23:06.725 --> 00:23:08.702
Come over and sit by me.

00:23:08.857 --> 00:23:11.544
- I've missed you.
- I went by all the way through the

00:23:11.569 --> 00:23:13.694
Cretaceous, to the
Jurassic in one day.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.114
My. What did you see?

00:23:15.153 --> 00:23:18.254
Nothing but herbivores. There
was one T-Rex, though.

00:23:18.544 --> 00:23:21.634
Casualties, of course.
Ours included.

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:23.247
She jumped out of her skin.

00:23:24.739 --> 00:23:27.137
You have your mother's
wicked sense of humor.

00:23:30.114 --> 00:23:31.950
Do I look like her?

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:34.395
Oh, yes.

00:23:35.677 --> 00:23:37.903
You could be her mirror image.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.567
Did my mother ever
visit the park?

00:23:42.989 --> 00:23:44.036
Once.

00:23:44.325 --> 00:23:46.450
A long time ago.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.114
She would have saved
them too, you know.

00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:52.317
She would have saved them all.

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:51.149
Claire.

00:24:54.157 --> 00:24:55.985
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.861
What kind of operation
you've got going on here?

00:24:57.885 --> 00:25:01.635
Mr. Lockwood takes his humanitarian
efforts very seriously.

00:25:01.658 --> 00:25:04.533
Where's the raptor wrangler?

00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:07.133
Animal behaviourist. Owen Grady.

00:25:07.158 --> 00:25:08.758
Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.

00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:11.353
And you're our,
great white hunter?

00:25:12.174 --> 00:25:14.981
Yes, I'm the expedition's
facilitator.

00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:17.825
Oh, God! It's hot!

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.095
It's about to get a
whole lot hotter.

00:25:49.343 --> 00:25:50.686
Bug spray?

00:25:51.202 --> 00:25:52.561
Bug spray?

00:25:55.187 --> 00:25:57.124
The T-Rex should be
dead by now, right?

00:25:57.171 --> 00:25:59.446
Yeah, well it's impossible
to know the max life span

00:25:59.472 --> 00:26:01.710
of a clone in a completely
different environment.

00:26:01.874 --> 00:26:03.866
Take a caveman that
would've lived 20 years.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.967
Feed him prime meals, give him
healthcare, he's gonna live...

00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:08.624
Five times as long.

00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:13.054
So, she'd be dead by now.

00:26:13.796 --> 00:26:15.155
Right?

00:27:00.516 --> 00:27:02.484
Bad memories?

00:27:04.274 --> 00:27:06.422
Some are good.

00:27:16.724 --> 00:27:18.270
What was that?

00:27:24.329 --> 00:27:25.930
Is it the T-Rex?

00:27:33.133 --> 00:27:35.086
I have to see this.

00:27:35.508 --> 00:27:37.203
Hey, Miss?

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.227
Miss! This area's not secured.

00:28:11.896 --> 00:28:13.544
Look at that.

00:28:14.364 --> 00:28:17.035
Never thought I'd see
one in real life.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.207
She's beautiful.

00:28:32.126 --> 00:28:33.595
Shall we?

00:28:47.207 --> 00:28:49.253
Okay! Let's go.

00:28:53.143 --> 00:28:56.439
Okay, I'm good.
Viewing system...

00:29:09.567 --> 00:29:12.277
Come on, tiger. You
know what you're doing?

00:29:17.135 --> 00:29:19.252
After you, tiger.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.275
Are we sure these biometric
chips are still transmitting?

00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:26.853
Battery would be dead by now.

00:29:26.885 --> 00:29:31.072
The dinosaur is the battery. They're
powered by body heat and movement.

00:29:31.284 --> 00:29:32.494
Hand.

00:29:35.955 --> 00:29:37.783
How much longer until...

00:29:40.455 --> 00:29:41.892
I'm in.

00:29:45.044 --> 00:29:47.036
There's a large concentration
on the East Dock.

00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:49.559
That's our boat. We've already
captured a bunch of them.

00:29:49.583 --> 00:29:51.551
Without the tracking system?

00:29:51.591 --> 00:29:55.020
The big herbivores were easy to find.
Can you isolate that raptor?

00:29:55.044 --> 00:29:57.153
- I need a species code.
- D-9.

00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:02.255
There she is.

00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:05.137
- I'm gonna need to borrow your truck.
- I'm coming with you.

00:30:05.177 --> 00:30:07.161
We don't know what kind of
condition she might be in.

00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:10.059
Miss, things could
get hairy out there.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.577
These are powerful sedatives.

00:30:14.602 --> 00:30:16.911
One too many, and she could
have respiratory failure.

00:30:16.946 --> 00:30:20.375
Also, I'm not as soft and witless
as your comment implies.

00:30:21.482 --> 00:30:23.567
Let's go, Beefcake.

00:30:23.693 --> 00:30:25.560
Oh, Owen...

00:30:27.459 --> 00:30:29.333
Be careful. Okay?

00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:34.773
If I don't make it back...

00:30:35.954 --> 00:30:37.484
Remember.

00:30:37.594 --> 00:30:39.633
You're the one who made me come.

00:30:41.492 --> 00:30:42.851
I'll be all right.

00:30:52.945 --> 00:30:55.796
We're not gonna get any closer
if we're riding this thing.

00:30:57.062 --> 00:30:59.359
- You should stop here.
- Pull up!

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:03.187
Move out. Look alive.
Stay alive.

00:31:03.234 --> 00:31:05.866
- We got your back, brother.
- Yeah.

00:31:06.804 --> 00:31:08.741
Claire, I'm gonna have
to track for a moment.

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:11.078
I'll need you to be my
eyes if she runs. Copy?

00:31:11.103 --> 00:31:12.436
Copy that.

00:31:47.562 --> 00:31:50.976
Wheatley, I'm on a fresh sign.
Wait for my signal.

00:32:16.854 --> 00:32:18.924
There you are.

00:32:32.961 --> 00:32:35.718
Hey, Girl. You miss me?

00:32:37.757 --> 00:32:40.819
Easy. Hey! Hey.

00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:44.272
I brought you something.

00:32:49.349 --> 00:32:51.169
There you go.

00:32:51.451 --> 00:32:53.411
That's right.

00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:56.981
Okay.

00:33:03.483 --> 00:33:05.170
You know me.

00:33:05.998 --> 00:33:07.599
Eyes on me.

00:33:14.036 --> 00:33:15.676
You know me.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.293
That's right.

00:33:19.192 --> 00:33:20.192
That's right.

00:33:22.348 --> 00:33:23.449
Hold your....

00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:27.894
I told you to wait
for my signal!

00:33:31.925 --> 00:33:33.792
Back your men off, right now.

00:33:46.603 --> 00:33:48.462
No, don't shoot her!

00:33:56.096 --> 00:33:58.814
Wheatley, you son of a bitch!

00:34:06.863 --> 00:34:09.270
Owen! What are you doing?

00:34:09.426 --> 00:34:10.558
Owen.

00:34:19.884 --> 00:34:21.665
You shoot me...

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:23.407
And that animal dies.

00:34:23.532 --> 00:34:25.493
I think we have the drop
on you, sweetheart.

00:34:25.509 --> 00:34:27.009
She's losing blood.

00:34:27.068 --> 00:34:28.700
And if I don't treat her...

00:34:29.426 --> 00:34:31.551
She'll never make
it back to camp.

00:34:40.906 --> 00:34:41.953
How ' bout this then...

00:34:41.977 --> 00:34:44.609
If that animal
dies, I shoot you.

00:34:44.672 --> 00:34:46.827
You're gonna take care of her.

00:34:47.468 --> 00:34:48.772
Let's move out!

00:35:01.903 --> 00:35:05.090
Get to the car, let's go!
Let's get out of here.

00:35:09.597 --> 00:35:11.198
No, no!

00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:18.915
Wait, are they protecting us?
What's going on?

00:35:20.478 --> 00:35:21.954
I don't think so.

00:35:23.962 --> 00:35:25.704
Why am I here?

00:35:29.602 --> 00:35:32.805
Hey, Mills. We gathered the dinos.
Mission accomplished.

00:35:36.085 --> 00:35:37.623
And just in the nick of time.

00:35:37.648 --> 00:35:40.766
Wheatley what the hell is going on there?
We're a day behind schedule already.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.522
I want that money in the bank by
the time I get back, alright?

00:35:43.554 --> 00:35:46.397
Okay, listen to me.
No more delays, okay?

00:35:46.593 --> 00:35:49.061
If we don't get... not
now, Maisie, thank you.

00:35:49.116 --> 00:35:52.444
- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs...
- I said not now!

00:35:56.276 --> 00:35:58.862
I'm sorry, honey. This
is an important call.

00:35:58.924 --> 00:36:01.588
If you would go up to the library, I'll
meet you up there in a few minutes.

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:02.626
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:36:02.657 --> 00:36:04.735
I'll tell you all about it.
I promise.

00:36:04.759 --> 00:36:05.922
Okay.

00:36:07.258 --> 00:36:08.601
Wheatley?

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:12.054
You get, those
animals, here, now.

00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:14.125
I want that bonus.
We got the blue one.

00:36:14.141 --> 00:36:17.633
- Bring her to me first.
- All right.

00:37:53.073 --> 00:37:56.174
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Hello?

00:37:56.291 --> 00:37:58.205
Hello? Is anybody there?

00:37:58.268 --> 00:38:00.346
Can anybody copy?

00:38:01.627 --> 00:38:04.220
I'm trying everything.
It's jammed.

00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:07.783
"It's a tough job, son. Build your
people skills." Yeah, thanks, Dad.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.641
That's it.

00:38:12.922 --> 00:38:14.790
Proximity alert.

00:38:15.743 --> 00:38:17.399
Something's coming.

00:38:17.454 --> 00:38:19.258
Where does that tunnel lead?

00:38:19.524 --> 00:38:22.195
Well, it connects to
the rest of the...

00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:24.291
park.

00:38:27.642 --> 00:38:29.674
It's the T-Rex. It's the T-Rex.

00:38:29.721 --> 00:38:31.260
Claire, it's the T-Rex.
It's the T-Rex.

00:38:31.285 --> 00:38:33.245
Will you stop? It's
not the T-Rex.

00:38:34.714 --> 00:38:37.253
- Probably.
- Probably?

00:38:39.198 --> 00:38:41.831
Lava! Lava!

00:38:42.088 --> 00:38:42.941
Lava...

00:38:42.966 --> 00:38:45.252
Deep breaths, Franklin...

00:39:00.677 --> 00:39:03.966
- See? Not a T-Rex!
- This is bigger!

00:39:14.654 --> 00:39:18.279
Claire, what do we do?
What do we do?

00:39:20.318 --> 00:39:23.404
It's stuck! Chair!

00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:40.931
Come on! Let's go.

00:39:41.883 --> 00:39:44.141
Come on, Franklin!

00:39:44.172 --> 00:39:46.718
We made it! Yeah!

00:40:06.787 --> 00:40:09.084
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Claire!

00:40:12.677 --> 00:40:14.919
Yes, let's go!

00:40:27.409 --> 00:40:28.807
Claire.

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:32.237
Holy...

00:40:43.313 --> 00:40:45.070
Run!

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:47.820
Run!

00:40:49.437 --> 00:40:50.726
Run!

00:42:02.805 --> 00:42:04.673
Go! Go.

00:42:08.282 --> 00:42:09.781
Get in!

00:43:29.013 --> 00:43:30.528
Owen!

00:44:22.345 --> 00:44:25.015
We didn't die. We just
fell from a cliff.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.868
We're alive! We're alive.

00:44:27.884 --> 00:44:30.204
Franklin, move!

00:44:31.384 --> 00:44:32.935
No, no, no!

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:36.841
Claire, we're gonna
sink, water's leaking!

00:44:39.477 --> 00:44:41.594
We need to get out!

00:44:43.727 --> 00:44:45.836
Franklin, watch out!

00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:51.179
I wanna go home!

00:44:53.867 --> 00:44:56.147
Owen. Owen!

00:44:56.171 --> 00:44:57.429
Owen?

00:45:00.015 --> 00:45:02.218
Move. Move!

00:45:06.406 --> 00:45:07.952
No, no, no...

00:45:12.554 --> 00:45:14.046
Owen!

00:45:17.328 --> 00:45:19.156
Where is he going?

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.843
Okay, don't panic. Don't panic.

00:45:22.241 --> 00:45:24.866
- We're not gonna make it, Claire.
- We are. We are.

00:45:24.897 --> 00:45:26.905
Take a deep breath.

00:46:36.977 --> 00:46:39.352
- Where's Zia?
- It was a double-cross. They took her.

00:46:39.375 --> 00:46:42.585
She must be with Blue. Hey,
can you still track 'em?

00:46:44.563 --> 00:46:46.460
Not anymore.

00:46:47.375 --> 00:46:48.616
It was a lie.

00:46:48.773 --> 00:46:52.351
It was a lie. Bastards!
It was all a lie!

00:47:06.443 --> 00:47:08.435
Not all of it.

00:47:18.865 --> 00:47:20.700
Move! Move!

00:47:20.724 --> 00:47:23.505
Anything of value, I want out of here.
Let's go.

00:47:23.568 --> 00:47:25.263
What are you doing?

00:47:25.287 --> 00:47:28.935
Well just put it up and we'll tow it on.
Let's go!

00:47:50.342 --> 00:47:51.982
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

00:47:51.991 --> 00:47:56.232
Wait up. Wait up. Stop that truck.
Stop it.

00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:02.776
Hey, sweetheart. Hey, girl.
Hey, girl.

00:48:12.173 --> 00:48:15.149
You're gonna feel that
when you wake up.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.016
Hey, put your weapon down!

00:48:22.686 --> 00:48:25.358
- They have Zia. They're loading out.
- They already have the dinosaurs.

00:48:25.389 --> 00:48:27.006
Why do they need us?

00:48:27.327 --> 00:48:30.162
They needed the tracking
system to capture Blue.

00:48:30.733 --> 00:48:33.358
There she is. She
don't look good.

00:48:36.655 --> 00:48:38.600
We need to get on that boat.

00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:42.000
- The rock's good. We're safe on the rock.
- Just get up, Franklin.

00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:44.789
All right, boat's good.
I'm on it.

00:48:47.622 --> 00:48:50.442
Get on the boat! Get
on the boat now!

00:48:58.193 --> 00:49:00.161
Get to that truck!

00:49:17.337 --> 00:49:20.665
- Franklin!
- Hey, get that truck going.

00:49:21.226 --> 00:49:22.820
- Are you okay?
- Am I dead?

00:49:22.842 --> 00:49:24.531
Not yet, kid.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.289
Come on! Give me your hand.

00:49:53.252 --> 00:49:54.814
Hold on!

00:51:58.439 --> 00:52:02.454
Mr. Mills? Your
visitor's waiting.

00:52:06.755 --> 00:52:08.544
Mr. Eversoll.

00:52:08.598 --> 00:52:11.371
It's a pleasure to meet you in person
after all this time. How are you?

00:52:11.387 --> 00:52:13.207
Excuse me, where
are the dinosaurs?

00:52:13.223 --> 00:52:15.660
The dinosaurs... are en route.

00:52:15.871 --> 00:52:18.246
Oh, so am I supposed
to sell these ones?

00:52:18.254 --> 00:52:20.715
You don't need to worry, okay?
They will be here soon.

00:52:20.793 --> 00:52:23.027
I don't really work
with amateurs,

00:52:23.043 --> 00:52:25.331
so I'm gonna contact my
buyers and call this off.

00:52:25.356 --> 00:52:28.419
They will be here tomorrow and your
buyers won't be disappointed. Trust me.

00:52:28.444 --> 00:52:31.856
Whatever their interest. Agricultural,
industrial, sport-hunting.

00:52:31.889 --> 00:52:34.762
We will have something to suit them.
Eleven species.

00:52:34.787 --> 00:52:37.928
Each with unique,
bio-pharmaceutical properties.

00:52:37.952 --> 00:52:40.482
I estimate $4 million
per species.

00:52:40.928 --> 00:52:44.514
$4 million is a slow
Tuesday where I'm from.

00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:46.343
You're wasting my time.

00:52:46.368 --> 00:52:49.686
You ready to make $100
million on a Tuesday? Huh?

00:52:51.317 --> 00:52:53.145
All of this is in the past.

00:52:54.106 --> 00:52:56.793
Now, I wanna talk to
you about the future.

00:52:57.575 --> 00:52:59.926
I'll give you ten minutes.

00:53:01.551 --> 00:53:04.668
The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs

00:53:04.693 --> 00:53:06.973
is to finance our
future operations here.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.262
It's, uh... seed money.

00:53:09.287 --> 00:53:12.426
Call it an overture to
something much more ambitious.

00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:14.848
Yeah. And more
lucrative, I guess.

00:53:14.873 --> 00:53:17.755
Right. We've reactivated
the old facilities,

00:53:17.771 --> 00:53:21.701
updated the technology and imported the
best geneticists from around the world.

00:53:21.732 --> 00:53:24.216
This operation has been
many years in the planning.

00:53:24.248 --> 00:53:27.294
Genetic power is an
uncharted frontier.

00:53:27.529 --> 00:53:30.919
The potential for growth is
more than you can fathom.

00:53:33.326 --> 00:53:34.786
This way, please.

00:53:34.919 --> 00:53:38.200
If the entire run of our sorry
history has taught us one

00:53:38.216 --> 00:53:39.638
irrevocable lesson,

00:53:39.663 --> 00:53:42.897
it's that man is
inevitably drawn to war.

00:53:42.921 --> 00:53:46.991
And is willing to use any
means necessary to win it.

00:53:47.092 --> 00:53:48.323
You're gonna weaponize them?

00:53:48.348 --> 00:53:50.733
We've been using animals
in combat for centuries.

00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:52.694
Horses, elephants.

00:53:52.702 --> 00:53:56.084
The Soviets used disease-bearing rats
against the Germans in Stalingrad.

00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:57.717
- Yes, yes.
- Our geneticists,

00:53:57.749 --> 00:54:01.788
have created a direct descendant,
of Henry Wu's masterpiece.

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.889
The animal that took
down Jurassic World.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.427
Indominus Rex.

00:54:06.458 --> 00:54:08.692
Her DNA, retrieved
from the island,

00:54:08.716 --> 00:54:11.591
way before its destruction,
forms the architecture

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:14.403
of a completely new creature.

00:54:14.529 --> 00:54:18.114
Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.

00:54:18.145 --> 00:54:22.605
And thanks to Owen Grady's research,
it follows human command.

00:54:22.996 --> 00:54:26.706
We call it, the Indoraptor.

00:54:33.528 --> 00:54:36.965
Grandpa? Grandpa?

00:54:55.915 --> 00:54:58.368
- Grandpa.
- Maisie.

00:54:58.439 --> 00:54:59.696
What are you doing up?

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.337
There was a man here today, with Mr.
Mills.

00:55:02.369 --> 00:55:05.993
It was probably just some business
about the Century, is all.

00:55:06.025 --> 00:55:07.400
I heard them talking.

00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:10.759
They're going to sell the dinosaurs.
They're bringing them here.

00:55:11.306 --> 00:55:12.782
I'm sure you misunderstood.

00:55:12.807 --> 00:55:14.744
- I know what I heard, Grandpa.
- Maisie...

00:55:14.768 --> 00:55:17.275
it's way past your bedtime.

00:55:17.479 --> 00:55:19.135
Let's talk about
this in the morning.

00:55:19.164 --> 00:55:20.546
- But...
- Maisie.

00:55:20.648 --> 00:55:23.780
I'll find out tomorrow.
Go to bed.

00:55:25.554 --> 00:55:28.577
- Good night.
- Good night, my heart.

00:55:58.255 --> 00:55:59.505
Jesus!

00:56:07.096 --> 00:56:09.666
Hold on. Just a little longer.

00:56:09.729 --> 00:56:12.213
Oh, my God, you guys are alive!

00:56:16.197 --> 00:56:18.087
Look what they've done to her.

00:56:18.119 --> 00:56:20.471
- Who are these assholes?
- Animal traffickers.

00:56:20.496 --> 00:56:22.768
Look how they're treating them. They're
not gonna take them to a sanctuary,

00:56:22.793 --> 00:56:24.361
- they're gonna sell them.
- Not Blue.

00:56:24.392 --> 00:56:26.689
- They need her for something else.
- Like what?

00:56:26.736 --> 00:56:28.354
I don't know, but she's...

00:56:28.379 --> 00:56:32.152
She's hemorrhaging and I don't have
instruments to keep her alive.

00:56:34.981 --> 00:56:37.855
Claire, come here.
Put your hand here.

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:39.456
Steady pressure.

00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:40.987
Hey, hey.

00:56:43.577 --> 00:56:46.537
I can't take the bullet out without
a transfusion from another animal.

00:56:46.562 --> 00:56:48.545
Which one of you guys
know how to find a vein?

00:56:48.554 --> 00:56:50.616
I did a blood drive
with Red Cross.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.749
Great! Okay.

00:56:53.022 --> 00:56:54.968
Franklin, you take
over for Claire.

00:56:55.023 --> 00:56:58.108
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Franklin! Now!

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.851
Steady pressure.

00:57:02.992 --> 00:57:04.897
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

00:57:04.937 --> 00:57:07.405
Is it in my mouth? Did
it get in my mouth?

00:57:07.702 --> 00:57:09.545
- Sure?
- You're good.

00:57:09.874 --> 00:57:11.475
All of the animals
should be sedated.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.476
Look for any type of () their blood
type should be close enough.

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.890
Look for carnivores, with two or
three fingers. No more than three.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:21.749
I think there is one on board.

00:57:36.525 --> 00:57:38.298
You've got to be kidding me.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.953
She's tranqed.

00:58:01.899 --> 00:58:04.477
Okay, okay. I got it, come on.

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:05.547
Okay.

00:58:12.374 --> 00:58:14.311
Are you okay?

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.944
I'm okay!

00:58:16.124 --> 00:58:17.389
Come on.

00:58:22.681 --> 00:58:24.783
- You're gonna have to do it.
- I can't

00:58:24.808 --> 00:58:27.899
The skin is too thick, I'd have to use
both hands to put pressure on the vein.

00:58:27.923 --> 00:58:30.485
- You gotta do it.
- I, I can't, I can't reach...

00:58:30.511 --> 00:58:32.737
You're gonna have
to climb up there.

00:58:33.737 --> 00:58:34.737
Oh, I'm not...

00:58:34.808 --> 00:58:36.136
I'm not gonna climb up there.

00:58:36.175 --> 00:58:38.206
You'll be okay. It's
like riding a bull.

00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:41.434
Riding a bull? I didn't grow up in
a rodeo or wherever you came from.

00:58:41.459 --> 00:58:44.473
She's asleep now. I can't say that she's
gonna be asleep a minute from now.

00:58:44.498 --> 00:58:46.458
- So, get up.
- Okay, fine.

00:58:46.505 --> 00:58:49.590
Oh my God, she stinks. Jesus!

00:59:02.667 --> 00:59:04.003
Good job.

00:59:04.206 --> 00:59:06.722
You're making this
look totally normal.

00:59:08.886 --> 00:59:12.261
You're gonna have to jam it in here.
It's really thick skin.

00:59:12.519 --> 00:59:13.604
Ready?

00:59:14.112 --> 00:59:16.323
One, two...

00:59:18.854 --> 00:59:20.205
Owen!

00:59:28.686 --> 00:59:31.013
It's working.

00:59:34.803 --> 00:59:36.029
Who left this open?

00:59:36.188 --> 00:59:37.188
I got it.

00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:56.440
The bars!

00:59:57.518 --> 01:00:00.275
I can get through here. Come on.

01:00:12.806 --> 01:00:14.524
Jump! Owen!

01:00:32.865 --> 01:00:34.489
Did you see that?

01:00:36.529 --> 01:00:38.584
Please tell me you
have the blood.

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.308
This is Delta. She is one of
the four little therapods.

01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:07.284
One of the survivors
from the second group.

01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:08.425
Now, watch this.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:11.527
If I show any sign of
weakness, whatsoever...

01:02:17.105 --> 01:02:18.528
You see that?

01:02:18.553 --> 01:02:22.888
Day 176. Blue is showing
unprecedented levels of compliance.

01:02:23.233 --> 01:02:25.342
Here I am with Blue.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:28.670
She's a therapod
from a new group.

01:02:28.795 --> 01:02:32.084
If I show signs of weakness...

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:45.884
Hey...

01:02:47.352 --> 01:02:48.774
I'm okay.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:50.999
She...

01:02:51.358 --> 01:02:53.103
She's pretty extraordinary.

01:03:03.918 --> 01:03:04.918
Blue...

01:03:05.052 --> 01:03:09.145
displaying levels of
interest, concern,

01:03:09.177 --> 01:03:12.700
hyperintelligence,
cognitive bonding...

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.223
See that?

01:03:15.474 --> 01:03:18.755
Tilting her head, she's
playing for us...

01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:21.559
Increased eye movement,
she's curious.

01:03:21.584 --> 01:03:23.660
She's showing empathy.

01:03:24.584 --> 01:03:27.919
Okay, I'm gonna make an incision
on her leg to remove the bullet.

01:03:32.006 --> 01:03:34.334
It's a lot of muscle tissue.

01:04:07.222 --> 01:04:09.136
She's gonna be okay.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.084
Blue is the key.

01:04:18.733 --> 01:04:20.287
You have Blue...

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:22.701
You'll get these raptors
to do anything.

01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:23.960
You're sure she'll live?

01:04:23.974 --> 01:04:25.363
If it dies, we have
blood samples.

01:04:25.388 --> 01:04:29.067
No, that's not good enough. The
raptor is a behavioural specimen.

01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:32.317
- We need her in good health.
- I didn't shoot the damn thing.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:34.755
What do you want me to do, huh?

01:04:35.013 --> 01:04:39.614
You don't have the faintest
comprehension of what I'm doing here.

01:04:39.763 --> 01:04:43.928
Do you understand the complexity of
creating an entirely new lifeform?

01:04:43.953 --> 01:04:47.562
No, but I understand the
complexity of paying for it. Okay?

01:04:47.594 --> 01:04:51.304
All your money will have been wasted if
I don't get Blue here in good health.

01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:53.945
To get the next iteration
under control,

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:57.515
it needs to form a familial bond
with a closely related genetic link.

01:04:57.523 --> 01:05:00.609
- English, Henry.
- It needs a mother!

01:05:02.177 --> 01:05:06.333
Blue's DNA will be part of the
next Indoraptor's make up.

01:05:06.358 --> 01:05:09.233
So it will be genetically coded
to recognize her authority

01:05:09.279 --> 01:05:10.756
and assume her traits.

01:05:10.796 --> 01:05:14.225
Empathy. Obedience. Everything the
prototype you have now is missing.

01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:18.328
- Okay, so how long is this gonna take?
- It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:21.171
- It's a marathon.
- Marathon sounds expensive.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.296
Besides, time is running out
and so is my patience, Henry.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.492
You have to understand. This
is all uncharted territory.

01:05:27.539 --> 01:05:31.546
A wolf, genetically, is barely
distinguishable from a bulldog.

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:34.429
But within that gray area....

01:05:35.663 --> 01:05:37.337
is heart.

01:05:37.514 --> 01:05:41.045
Spare me the poetry, Henry. Can you do it?
Can you do it?

01:05:41.077 --> 01:05:42.951
Yes, I can do it.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:44.724
Well then, do it!

01:05:44.764 --> 01:05:46.107
Thank you.

01:05:46.498 --> 01:05:48.771
God, you brainy asshole.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.145
Hey, hey! Maisie!

01:06:06.513 --> 01:06:09.301
What is that? What is it?

01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:19.366
Keep her in there, and
keep the door locked.

01:06:19.405 --> 01:06:22.240
- You want to keep her locked in?
- That's exactly what I want.

01:06:22.257 --> 01:06:24.662
Sir Benjamin needs
to see her now.

01:06:27.827 --> 01:06:29.959
I believe it's important.

01:07:08.773 --> 01:07:10.085
We're here.

01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:11.156
Where?

01:07:15.836 --> 01:07:17.258
She got a heartbeat?

01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:18.961
Yeah. Do you?

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:20.132
We need blood samples.

01:07:20.157 --> 01:07:21.961
I'm not here to help you
reset the food chain,

01:07:21.986 --> 01:07:25.110
so take your own damn samples.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.884
What a nasty woman.

01:07:38.716 --> 01:07:40.263
Hey!

01:07:41.028 --> 01:07:42.934
- What the hell is going on?
- I was...

01:07:43.779 --> 01:07:45.973
I needed an extra pair of hands.
He volunteered.

01:07:45.998 --> 01:07:47.544
- You deck crew?
- Aye-aye.

01:07:47.568 --> 01:07:49.239
We're logging out. Follow me.

01:07:49.264 --> 01:07:51.201
Does that mean we're leaving the ship?
Right now?

01:07:51.217 --> 01:07:54.232
That means what that means.
Now get moving. Come on, follow me!

01:07:55.755 --> 01:07:57.801
- Shit!
- Oh, no.

01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:59.778
He's not gonna make it.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:02.809
- We have to help him.
- Stay here. I'll get him.

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:06.520
There's no time. Let's go.

01:08:22.045 --> 01:08:23.045
Roll out!

01:08:24.474 --> 01:08:26.388
Where are they taking them?

01:08:26.428 --> 01:08:28.162
We're about to find out.

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:49.296
Yes!

01:08:55.442 --> 01:08:57.009
Lockwood's Estate?

01:08:59.081 --> 01:09:01.627
He must have one big-ass garage.

01:09:47.315 --> 01:09:50.315
Did you really think you
could get away with it?

01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:53.009
In my own house.

01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:54.760
You entrusted me.

01:09:55.432 --> 01:09:58.478
To guide your fortune
into the future.

01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:01.423
- I have done that.
- Damn you!

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.450
Pick up that phone.

01:10:06.622 --> 01:10:09.879
I want you to call the police.

01:10:10.419 --> 01:10:13.872
It'll be easier if the
story comes from you.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.684
As you say, sir.

01:10:24.188 --> 01:10:26.016
You know, I've been thinking...

01:10:26.032 --> 01:10:28.336
John Hammond was right.

01:10:28.868 --> 01:10:32.203
It was an unholy
thing that you did.

01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:39.031
I'm not the only guilty
one here, am I, sir?

01:10:57.672 --> 01:10:58.727
Hey.

01:11:00.851 --> 01:11:04.140
We hit that town and we call
the cavalry to shut this down.

01:11:09.046 --> 01:11:12.523
Hello. You should've
stayed on the island.

01:11:12.758 --> 01:11:14.585
Better odds.

01:11:25.332 --> 01:11:26.869
Hi, Claire.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.080
I just wanted to
come and apologize.

01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:33.049
I didn't want to bring
you into any of this,

01:11:33.074 --> 01:11:36.066
but it was the only way
that we can get the raptor.

01:11:36.082 --> 01:11:37.730
And we needed it.

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.128
Come on.

01:11:40.535 --> 01:11:42.011
So, what?

01:11:42.036 --> 01:11:43.582
This is it?

01:11:43.644 --> 01:11:48.917
I mean, you're a smart guy who started a
foundation to cure cancer. But instead, you...

01:11:49.549 --> 01:11:50.549
What?

01:11:51.779 --> 01:11:54.259
- Sell endangered species?
- I saved these animals.

01:11:54.291 --> 01:11:56.509
You betrayed a dying
man for money.

01:11:56.541 --> 01:12:00.478
Claire, I admire your idealism, but
we both exploited these animals.

01:12:00.494 --> 01:12:02.439
At least, I have the
integrity to admit it.

01:12:02.463 --> 01:12:07.400
- I never, ever did anything remotely illegal.
- You authorized the creation of the Indominus Rex.

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:12.008
You exploited a living
thing, in a cage, for money.

01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:14.923
How is that different?
Huh? And you.

01:12:15.025 --> 01:12:17.430
The man who proved raptors
can follow orders.

01:12:17.469 --> 01:12:20.570
You never thought about the
applications of your research, Owen?

01:12:20.688 --> 01:12:23.570
How many millions a trained
predator might be worth?

01:12:26.332 --> 01:12:27.481
You two...

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.746
You're the parents
of the new world.

01:12:33.278 --> 01:12:35.114
Hey! Let him go.

01:12:35.153 --> 01:12:36.950
- Owen?
- I think I'll break it.

01:12:36.973 --> 01:12:38.559
Let him go.

01:12:42.663 --> 01:12:43.663
Claire, it's....

01:12:52.354 --> 01:12:53.974
Say the word, we
got them, Mills.

01:12:54.011 --> 01:12:59.042
Well, as far as everybody else is
concerned, they burned up on the island.

01:13:16.635 --> 01:13:18.479
Looks like a full house.

01:13:19.019 --> 01:13:20.385
Roger that.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.980
- Good evening.
- Good evening, good evening.

01:13:49.005 --> 01:13:51.293
Welcome. Welcome.

01:13:52.692 --> 01:13:56.357
This guy, he's Ricky Rathrow.
Darius Pharmaceuticals.

01:13:56.388 --> 01:13:57.325
Right.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:00.614
And the guy in the beard? He's
a proxy for Gregor Aldorich.

01:14:00.647 --> 01:14:02.803
Slovenian arms dealer.

01:14:37.248 --> 01:14:40.591
Well, he only wants carnivores.
Two of them.

01:14:40.623 --> 01:14:43.685
Looks like Lockwood's gonna
have a very good night.

01:14:43.724 --> 01:14:45.521
Will he be joining us?

01:14:45.599 --> 01:14:48.060
That's very unlikely.

01:15:00.179 --> 01:15:01.663
Grandpa?

01:15:08.996 --> 01:15:10.113
Grandpa?

01:15:11.417 --> 01:15:13.112
Grandpa, wake up.

01:15:14.659 --> 01:15:15.956
Grandpa.

01:15:17.315 --> 01:15:20.182
Grandpa, wake up. Wake up!

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.275
Iris!

01:15:35.548 --> 01:15:36.829
Iris!

01:15:39.749 --> 01:15:40.991
It's over.

01:15:44.561 --> 01:15:46.553
What a tragedy.

01:15:50.108 --> 01:15:52.537
I suppose now he's gone,

01:15:52.577 --> 01:15:55.608
- you'll be looking for another situation.
- No.

01:15:56.866 --> 01:15:59.030
Maisie needs me.

01:16:00.296 --> 01:16:03.076
I am her guardian now.

01:16:03.819 --> 01:16:06.764
What she needs is no
longer your concern.

01:16:07.491 --> 01:16:10.350
You don't understand
her the way I do.

01:16:11.194 --> 01:16:13.733
I understand her value.

01:16:14.719 --> 01:16:16.469
But I raised her.

01:16:16.992 --> 01:16:18.445
I raised...

01:16:18.477 --> 01:16:19.898
both of them.

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:26.618
- Please, Mr. Mills.
- Goodbye, Iris.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:10.639
Do you remember the first
time you saw a dinosaur?

01:17:12.592 --> 01:17:16.959
First time you see them,
it's like, a miracle.

01:17:17.217 --> 01:17:19.990
You read about them in books.
You see the bones in museums.

01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:22.599
But you don't really believe it.

01:17:22.928 --> 01:17:24.607
Kind of like myths.

01:17:25.428 --> 01:17:27.209
And then you see...

01:17:28.129 --> 01:17:30.769
the first one alive.

01:17:35.115 --> 01:17:37.044
This is not your fault.

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:40.146
- But it is.
- No.

01:17:41.952 --> 01:17:44.155
This one's on me.

01:17:45.952 --> 01:17:48.162
I showed them the way.

01:17:49.593 --> 01:17:51.350
Now, listen.

01:17:51.374 --> 01:17:54.983
You and I are gonna have plenty
of time to talk about this later.

01:17:54.999 --> 01:17:57.725
- If there is a later.
- Yes, there is.

01:17:59.944 --> 01:18:02.295
I got a cabin to finish.

01:18:10.456 --> 01:18:12.135
What is that?

01:18:15.753 --> 01:18:19.190
Well, look who just woke up.

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:31.374
We're getting out of here.

01:18:32.515 --> 01:18:36.756
Welcome, ladies, gentlemen...

01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:40.327
To this extraordinary evening.

01:18:40.366 --> 01:18:44.881
Let's dive right in,
with lot number 1.

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:47.717
The ankylosaurus.

01:18:49.085 --> 01:18:51.960
This is a herbivorous quadruped.

01:18:52.171 --> 01:18:54.124
Late Cretaceous.

01:18:54.226 --> 01:18:58.061
This is one of the largest
armored dinosaurs.

01:18:58.295 --> 01:19:03.146
Known by paleontologists
as a "living tank".

01:19:08.729 --> 01:19:11.541
- What are you doing?
- Save it.

01:19:11.674 --> 01:19:14.080
- Are you sure about this?
- Nope.

01:19:16.325 --> 01:19:19.239
I have $4 million dollars.
Anyone with 5?

01:19:19.357 --> 01:19:22.880
$5 million. $5 million.
Do I hear 6?

01:19:23.108 --> 01:19:26.912
$6 million. Thank you. Any increase on six?
Seven. $7 million.

01:19:26.999 --> 01:19:31.436
$8 million. $9 million on the phones.
Do I hear $10 million?

01:19:32.577 --> 01:19:35.537
$10 million. Once, twice...

01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:41.092
Sold! To the gentleman from Indonesia.
Congratulations.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:48.553
Lot number 2, ladies
and gentlemen.

01:19:49.311 --> 01:19:52.264
Juvenile Allosaurus.

01:19:53.787 --> 01:19:57.912
A fierce and
aggressive predator.

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:02.311
Sold!

01:20:02.803 --> 01:20:04.092
Sold!

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.317
Sold!

01:20:08.713 --> 01:20:12.081
Wonderful. Wonderful.

01:20:40.698 --> 01:20:42.097
Okay...

01:20:42.551 --> 01:20:45.691
Hey, hey you! Look
at me, look at me!

01:20:46.519 --> 01:20:47.722
Hey!

01:20:49.574 --> 01:20:50.714
Okay.

01:21:09.262 --> 01:21:11.082
You're welcome.

01:21:19.302 --> 01:21:22.966
Hey! Wait. Please, please, wait.

01:21:27.486 --> 01:21:29.977
That's Lockwood's granddaughter.

01:21:30.884 --> 01:21:32.806
Hey. Hey, kid.

01:21:32.853 --> 01:21:35.267
You wanna come
down out of there?

01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:41.406
Do you remember me?

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:47.477
My name is Claire. What's yours?

01:21:48.118 --> 01:21:49.274
Maisie.

01:21:49.725 --> 01:21:52.326
- Maisie Lockwood.
- Maisie.

01:21:52.358 --> 01:21:55.264
This is my friend, Owen.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:22:00.241
I saw you, with the velociraptors.
And Blue.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.709
Oh, yeah?

01:22:05.596 --> 01:22:07.322
You like dinosaurs?

01:22:08.861 --> 01:22:11.806
So do I. Tell you what, you
come on down from there,

01:22:11.845 --> 01:22:14.274
I'll tell you everything you
need to know about Blue.

01:22:14.798 --> 01:22:16.485
That sound all right?

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.235
Alright. Yeah. Come on down.

01:22:29.158 --> 01:22:30.501
Sweetie...

01:22:30.775 --> 01:22:32.744
We need some help finding
your grandfather.

01:22:32.767 --> 01:22:35.212
Can you take us to him?

01:22:35.236 --> 01:22:36.329
No.

01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:39.118
You made it down here
all by yourself, huh.

01:22:39.142 --> 01:22:42.712
Brave kid. Looks like
you could use a friend.

01:22:43.415 --> 01:22:45.336
He's gone!

01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:51.335
So listen, I'll tell you what.

01:22:51.352 --> 01:22:55.406
We're just about to go and find our
friends and then get the heck outta here.

01:22:55.468 --> 01:22:57.343
You wanna come with us?

01:22:57.366 --> 01:22:59.546
We could use a friend, too.

01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:15.542
Sold!

01:23:15.612 --> 01:23:18.580
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, that we are

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.549
halfway through the evening...

01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:25.946
We'd like to offer a
special treat to our

01:23:26.142 --> 01:23:29.110
discriminating buyers.

01:23:29.384 --> 01:23:31.985
This evening, we will preview,

01:23:32.134 --> 01:23:35.586
a new asset that we've
been developing.

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:38.232
A creature of the future,

01:23:38.257 --> 01:23:40.818
made from pieces of the past.

01:23:42.599 --> 01:23:45.372
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be warned.

01:23:45.529 --> 01:23:49.622
This is the perfect blend of the
two most dangerous creatures...

01:23:49.647 --> 01:23:52.267
that have ever walked the earth.

01:23:52.655 --> 01:23:54.405
We call it...

01:23:54.647 --> 01:23:57.358
The Indoraptor.

01:24:18.591 --> 01:24:21.427
The perfect weapon
for the modern age.

01:24:21.719 --> 01:24:23.578
Built for combat.

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:27.679
With tactical responses more
acute than any human soldier.

01:24:27.704 --> 01:24:29.102
What is that thing?

01:24:45.942 --> 01:24:47.957
They made it.

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.926
Mr. Mills, and the other man.

01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:51.630
What man?

01:24:52.513 --> 01:24:53.271
Him.

01:24:53.287 --> 01:24:56.005
Designed by Mr. Henry Wu...

01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:59.763
Its' intelligence quotient
comparable to the velociraptor.

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:03.334
Bio-specs include
hyper sense of smell,

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:07.605
trained to respond to a pulse
coded, laser-targeting system.

01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:12.874
Enabling it to isolate and track
prey in complex environments.

01:25:12.898 --> 01:25:14.343
Voila!

01:25:20.687 --> 01:25:24.132
Now first, your laser
sets the target.

01:25:26.397 --> 01:25:31.706
Once locked on, the acoustic
signal triggers the attack.

01:25:37.808 --> 01:25:40.659
This animal is relentless.

01:25:40.722 --> 01:25:44.159
Now, modifications are
still being made.

01:25:44.207 --> 01:25:46.433
$20 million!

01:25:48.808 --> 01:25:52.800
Well, this is a prototype.
Not for sale.

01:25:52.825 --> 01:25:53.987
21!

01:25:54.035 --> 01:25:58.019
Well, it is still a
prototype, but...

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:01.128
23!

01:26:02.394 --> 01:26:04.058
24!

01:26:06.043 --> 01:26:07.886
$24 million.

01:26:07.949 --> 01:26:10.347
$25 million!

01:26:10.753 --> 01:26:12.355
Do I hear 26?

01:26:12.378 --> 01:26:14.823
That thing can't
leave this building.

01:26:14.862 --> 01:26:15.807
26!

01:26:15.932 --> 01:26:18.947
Any advance on 26? $27 million!

01:26:18.971 --> 01:26:20.971
What are you doing? This
animal is not for sale.

01:26:20.996 --> 01:26:23.252
Let them have it. We have
to give them a taste.

01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:29.619
- He's a prototype.
- This prototype is worth $28 million right now.

01:26:29.986 --> 01:26:32.751
Relax. We'll make some more.

01:26:32.822 --> 01:26:35.064
So will they.

01:26:55.939 --> 01:26:57.368
Hey, buddy.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.055
You thinking what I'm thinking?

01:27:01.728 --> 01:27:04.860
Once, twice, sold!

01:27:04.884 --> 01:27:07.032
To the Russian from...

01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:13.531
Congratulations for purchasing
this magnificent animal...

01:28:21.643 --> 01:28:23.900
Get this thing out of here!

01:29:15.596 --> 01:29:17.205
Mills!

01:29:17.464 --> 01:29:19.433
Mills, where are you?

01:29:20.042 --> 01:29:22.011
I want my bonus.

01:29:28.419 --> 01:29:31.942
Holy cow. What are you?

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:35.160
I didn't see you on the island.

01:29:52.909 --> 01:29:55.182
You are a tough guy.

01:30:27.658 --> 01:30:30.368
Look at that beauty.

01:30:31.227 --> 01:30:35.992
You're some kind of hot-rod.
With pretty teeth.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:40.616
This will make a perfect
centerpiece for my necklace.

01:30:59.303 --> 01:31:00.928
Open up...

01:31:54.948 --> 01:31:56.980
Move ! Move!

01:32:41.903 --> 01:32:43.340
Don't!

01:32:46.762 --> 01:32:49.403
You two, deserve each other.

01:32:49.512 --> 01:32:51.113
Maisie, come with me.

01:32:51.137 --> 01:32:53.705
You got your money. Walk away.

01:32:53.822 --> 01:32:54.994
What are you gonna do, huh?

01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:56.767
We're gonna stop this.

01:32:57.088 --> 01:32:58.830
- All of it!
- How?

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.736
What, you're gonna go back in time
before Hammond decides to play god?

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.596
You can't put it
back in the box!

01:33:03.674 --> 01:33:05.096
- We have to try.
- It's too late.

01:33:05.127 --> 01:33:07.002
Maisie, come.

01:33:10.609 --> 01:33:13.914
So, you're gonna take
care of her now? Huh?

01:33:14.579 --> 01:33:16.749
You have no idea what she is.

01:33:17.804 --> 01:33:21.093
What do you think drove Hammond
and Lockwood apart, huh?

01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:24.811
Lockwood never had a grandchild.

01:33:25.367 --> 01:33:27.890
He just wanted his
daughter back.

01:33:29.898 --> 01:33:32.531
And he had the technology.

01:33:32.847 --> 01:33:35.183
He created another.

01:33:36.512 --> 01:33:38.051
He made her again.

01:33:41.693 --> 01:33:42.904
Go!

01:33:48.457 --> 01:33:50.223
Come on!

01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:08.614
Get this to Mills. Be very careful.
It's extremely valuable.

01:34:08.623 --> 01:34:11.208
You, I need blood samples
from the raptor.

01:34:12.012 --> 01:34:13.558
Don't just stand
there like an idiot!

01:34:13.583 --> 01:34:18.286
Get me 50 cc carfentanil and a
lobotomy kit. It's right there. Now!

01:34:19.067 --> 01:34:20.801
Come on. Come on.

01:34:21.707 --> 01:34:24.551
I need this raptor's blood.

01:34:24.855 --> 01:34:26.964
Sure. Go ahead.

01:34:27.003 --> 01:34:29.206
Where is that kit?

01:34:29.261 --> 01:34:31.065
Okay, now listen to me.

01:34:31.113 --> 01:34:33.971
It's better if we cooperated.
But I'm gonna get this blood,

01:34:34.003 --> 01:34:36.762
- With or without your help.
- This blood's contaminated.

01:34:36.802 --> 01:34:39.356
I designed this animal myself.

01:34:39.552 --> 01:34:42.901
It's pure. Every cell of
her body was created in a

01:34:42.926 --> 01:34:46.645
most controlled environment under
the most demanding conditions.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.163
Yeah, but I did an intravenous
blood transfusion with a T-Rex,

01:34:50.171 --> 01:34:51.936
so, it's a sock drawer in there.

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.397
You what?

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:57.010
Hold, stop! What are you doing?

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.003
Saving your life.

01:35:03.809 --> 01:35:05.002
Yes!

01:35:05.049 --> 01:35:06.346
Stop!

01:35:08.276 --> 01:35:10.010
Don't move.

01:35:14.844 --> 01:35:16.766
Now, step away from that cage.

01:35:16.807 --> 01:35:17.901
Now.

01:35:54.019 --> 01:35:56.230
Run. Run!

01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:01.470
Run!

01:39:25.927 --> 01:39:27.474
You see that?

01:39:27.526 --> 01:39:32.166
That's hydrogen cyanide. If it reaches the
containment level, it will kill them all.

01:39:33.315 --> 01:39:35.151
The ventilation system is down.

01:39:35.283 --> 01:39:37.338
Can you bring it back up?

01:40:09.952 --> 01:40:12.764
The server's unresponsive. I
have to reboot the whole system.

01:40:12.835 --> 01:40:15.131
- So reboot it.
- I'm trying.

01:40:35.078 --> 01:40:37.656
- Franklin, we don't have time.
- I know, I know, I know.

01:40:37.734 --> 01:40:38.859
Okay.

01:41:19.117 --> 01:41:20.828
Go! Go!

01:42:18.537 --> 01:42:22.076
You're okay. Put pressure on it.
Don't look at it. Look at me.

01:42:22.107 --> 01:42:24.794
- You have to go find her.
- I can't leave you here.

01:42:29.292 --> 01:42:31.229
Go, I'll be fine.

01:42:31.284 --> 01:42:32.518
Run!

01:45:01.404 --> 01:45:03.513
Maisie, stay down!

01:46:07.788 --> 01:46:11.405
Follow me. I know a
way on the outside.

01:46:14.039 --> 01:46:15.367
Come on.

01:46:17.805 --> 01:46:19.398
Come on!

01:46:35.706 --> 01:46:37.151
This way!

01:47:10.204 --> 01:47:11.893
I got you.

01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:25.617
Hey!

01:49:20.846 --> 01:49:22.658
What the hell?

01:49:24.744 --> 01:49:25.806
Hey!

01:49:28.055 --> 01:49:30.874
Hey! You good?

01:49:32.749 --> 01:49:35.584
- Yeah. You?
- Nope!

01:49:35.882 --> 01:49:39.381
Hey, we have a problem downstairs.
I need you to come see this.

01:50:09.336 --> 01:50:10.906
They're all dying.

01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:13.382
The blast damaged the
ventilation system.

01:50:13.408 --> 01:50:15.923
We did everything we could.

01:50:18.298 --> 01:50:20.282
I can open the gates from here.

01:50:21.305 --> 01:50:23.992
Claire, be careful.

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:26.765
We're not on an island anymore.

01:51:22.216 --> 01:51:23.434
Claire....

01:51:23.521 --> 01:51:26.872
You press that button,
there is no going back.

01:51:31.594 --> 01:51:34.086
We can't let them die.

01:52:23.568 --> 01:52:25.233
I had to.

01:52:26.085 --> 01:52:28.038
They're alive.

01:52:28.076 --> 01:52:29.788
Like me.

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:44.225
Hey, girl.

01:54:44.249 --> 01:54:45.624
Owen.

01:54:47.773 --> 01:54:50.913
It's okay. She won't hurt us.

01:55:21.372 --> 01:55:23.982
Blue, come with me.

01:55:28.834 --> 01:55:31.919
We'll take you to a
safe place, okay?

01:56:10.606 --> 01:56:13.371
How many times do you
have to see the evidence?

01:56:13.918 --> 01:56:16.832
How many times must
a point be made?

01:56:17.582 --> 01:56:20.644
We're causing our
own extinction.

01:56:20.895 --> 01:56:23.628
Too many red lines
have been crossed.

01:56:24.176 --> 01:56:27.980
And our home has, in fundamental
ways, been polluted by

01:56:28.051 --> 01:56:30.566
avarice, and

01:56:30.668 --> 01:56:33.308
political megalomania.

01:56:33.903 --> 01:56:39.278
Genetic power has now been unleashed. And
of course, that's gonna be catastrophic.

01:56:39.395 --> 01:56:44.317
This change was inevitable, from the moment we
brought the first dinosaur back from extinction.

01:56:44.841 --> 01:56:47.574
We convince ourselves that
sudden change, is something that

01:56:47.591 --> 01:56:51.590
happens outside the normal order
of things, like a car crash.

01:56:52.017 --> 01:56:54.657
Or that it's beyond our control, like a fatal illness.

01:56:54.712 --> 01:56:59.009
We don't conceive of sudden,
radical, irrational change as

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.024
woven into the very
fabric of existence.

01:57:02.345 --> 01:57:05.423
Yet, I can assure you,
it most assuredly is.

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.970
And it's happening now.

01:57:10.586 --> 01:57:15.101
Humans and dinosaurs are now
gonna be forced to co-exist.

01:57:18.093 --> 01:57:21.100
These creatures were
here before us.

01:57:21.662 --> 01:57:25.014
And if we're not careful,
they're gonna be here after.

01:57:30.427 --> 01:57:34.294
We're gonna have to adjust to new
threats that we can't imagine.

01:57:40.194 --> 01:57:42.599
We've entered a new era.

01:57:43.803 --> 01:57:47.615
Welcome, to Jurassic World.
