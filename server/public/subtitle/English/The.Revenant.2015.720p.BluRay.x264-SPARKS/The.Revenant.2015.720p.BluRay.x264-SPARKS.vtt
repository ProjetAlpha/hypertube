00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.330
<i>It's okay, son...</i>

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.481
<i>I know you want this to be over.</i>

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.128
<i>I'm right here.</i>

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.171
<i>I will be right here...</i>

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.081
<i>But, you don't give up.</i>

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.050
<i>You hear me?</i>

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.926
<i>As long as you can still
grab a breath, you fight.</i>

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.967
<i>You breathe... keep breathing.</i>

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.851
Hawk.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.082
Ah, shit.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.571
Goddamn sumbitches.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.405
The sumbitch
got shit for brains.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.921
You seen Coulter?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.081
Nope.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.371
Listen up!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.045
When them plews is cleaned,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.248
I want you to hoop 'em up
real tight.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.559
Remember, we're not doing
no 15-pelt bales!

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560
We're going
30-pelt bales!

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.601
Fitzgerald!

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.641
Cap'n.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.644
Where are we with the haul?
What are you thinking?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.844
I'm thinking, whatever it is
they're hunting out there...

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.843
...I hope it don't need
another shot.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.088
Make sure we're ready
to head out by dawn.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.207
Been done by this morning.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.725
I'd have liked
to be out by how,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.888
but the men
are too tired.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.360
We're only a few days
from the fort.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.447
We're trapped out.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.922
All we have to worry about
is fresh meat for the boys.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.846
Well, you, uh, seen Coulter?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.644
Hey, we took down
an elk. A big one.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.449
We need help
to haul the meat back.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.045
Let me know
when it's on the spit.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.406
I'll help you
with it then.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.244
Come on, I need your help.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.641
We needed help when we were
loading them bales.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.645
I been eating this damn
beaver meat so long...

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.928
...I'm starting to
miss my wife's cooking.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.691
I'm starting
to miss your wife.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.807
Shut up.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.321
Help!

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.491
Help.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.331
Is that Coulter?

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.802
You go get the Captain.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.291
Jesus Christ.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.169
Anybody see them?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.811
Stay quiet.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.166
Watch the ridge.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.208
What was that?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.120
Pa?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.600
Let's go.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.724
They got Thomas.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.565
I can't see 'em.
I can't see 'em.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.085
Get down!

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.086
We're surrounded!
They're everywhere!

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.089
Stay here! Stay here!

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.605
Paul, no!

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.402
They want us out in the open.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.760
Nobody move!
Stay where you are!

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.809
They want the pelts.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.564
We got to get
on that boat right now

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.130
or we'll lose it all.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.282
Get to the boat!
To the boat, son! Move!

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.251
Move, move!

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.126
Leave the furs!
Leave the furs! To the boat!

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.442
Hawk!

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.965
Hawk!

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.970
Hawk!

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.522
Grab some pelts!
Come on, grab the pelts!

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.566
Grab the pelts!
Grab the pelts!

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.409
Give this
to my little girl.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.762
You're coming with us.
I'll get help.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.605
Leave the furs!
Leave the pelts!

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.566
Willman!

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.840
Lean on me.
Just keep going.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.602
Get to the boat!

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.085
Fucking savage!

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.641
Get on the fucking boat!

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.611
Help!

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.007
Cut the rope!
Cut the rope!

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.810
Wait for Amos!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.490
No! We go now!

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.649
Fire the cannon!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.526
Don't leave! Wait!

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.761
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.449
Collect all the pelts we can carry.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:50.169
We'll trade pelts with the French
for horses and keep searching for her.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.889
...and dust becomes flour...

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.204
...and when the morning
is clear...

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.570
...this child of God will meet
Jesus Christ himself. Amen.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.761
You ready?

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.091
Hold still.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.930
Where did you learn that?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.121
My father was a doctor.
Bridger!

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.680
Captain,
we got a swarm of

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.604
tree niggers out here
waiting to finish the job.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.406
Tell me you got
some kind of plan.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.601
Glass?

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.802
Missouri's no good.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.601
Not while the Ree's
running it.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.610
We got to
get off this boat.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.802
Oh, you want to
get off the boat?

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.129
Then what do we do, huh?

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.767
Take our furs and sit
out there amongst the Ree

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.490
like a bunch of ducks?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.963
Only safe thing to do is track
a new course back up on land.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.491
That'll add weeks
to the trip.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.682
Better than floating
where they can get eyes on us.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.327
They got eyes on you
right now, son.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.484
What I'm saying is
we stay on the boat.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.007
Chart a course
toward the fort

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.485
and take our chances
on the water.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.530
Glass knows
this territory best.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.170
It's his job
to get us home safe.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.401
Get us home safe?
Yeah.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.926
Need I remind you
we already lost 32 men?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.207
It's 33 now.
They were my men, Fitzgerald.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.123
I know how many I lost.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.651
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.571
We have to
set the boat loose.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.166
If the Ree are tracking us,
they'll find it downriver.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.323
Best course is to
hike inland to the Grand

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.084
and follow it
to Fort Kiowa.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.049
On foot?

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.326
It'll be winter
before we get there.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.050
Yeah, unless
we come across a post,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.246
trade for some horses.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.163
Ain't no posts
that far over!

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.563
Captain, losing this boat
is a goddamn mistake.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.002
The Ree
ain't that stupid.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.600
We keep it, we can lay it up
around Arrow's Peak.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.762
Quit acting like you know
what you're talking about.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.330
Ain't nobody talking to you.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.011
Who'd listen
to you anyway?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.442
Can't find your way out of
your breeches to take a shit.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.842
All I'm saying is
Camp Rhulen is just up the way.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.924
We can hole up there.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.850
We walk.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.522
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.324
Wish my dad
was a doctor.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.846
Then he could've bought me
a captain's job.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.291
What do we do, eh?

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.523
Pray these pelts ain't rotten
if we ever get back here?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.291
Make sure
to mark this place.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.886
We're leaving a fortune
under these rocks.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.451
Glass, chart a course.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.966
Tightest you can that
gets us around the Ree.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.370
This ain't right.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.404
We all know these furs

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.482
ain't gonna be here
by the time we come back.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.121
There's no way we can haul
them all the way to the fort.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.123
Arikara are
all through the territory.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.480
We'll want
our hands free.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.483
We're gonna
lose those pelts.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.085
You rather keep the pelts
or your life?

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.406
Life?

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.405
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.449
I just got living
and the only way I get that

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.329
is through these pelts.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.006
Fuck!

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.323
Ain't no way I'm going home
after six months

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.243
working my ass off
like a mule...

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.002
...risking my neck,
men dying, and for what?

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.605
Damn near lost everything.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.921
Job's been fucked
from the start!

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.922
There's the one
been fucking us.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.603
You wonder how the Ree
got the dead drop on us...

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.000
...when Mr. Glass
was supposed

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.963
to look out
for that very thing?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.362
All them Pawnee buddies of his.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.284
Pawnee's as much against
the Ree as the rest of us.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.441
Yeah?

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.606
Well, what about
his little half-breed son?

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.441
What kind of savage
you think his mama was?

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.363
Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.804
All I'm saying is...

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.805
...a savage... is savage.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.210
Hey, Glass...

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.720
...is it true
what they say

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.211
about you shooting a lieutenant

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.487
while living
with them savages?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.044
Twenty-one dead soldiers
and 40 dead feathernecks.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.327
But you and your boy
the only ones to walk out alive.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.522
Kind of a miracle.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.965
Shut up, Fitzgerald.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.166
Is that what you did?

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.641
Shot one of your own
to save this little dog here?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.286
Shut up!

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.723
Why? Was he playing with
this little boy's mama, huh?

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.490
Did he kill her?

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.571
Hey, you can quit
polishing that rifle

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.165
when I'm talking to you.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.925
I'm working on it.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.480
You can work on it
when I'm done talking to you.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.921
Look at me.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.331
That's enough!

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.761
You're forgetting
your place, boy.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.082
As far as I can tell,
my place is here

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.447
on the smart end
of this rifle.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.682
You move along, Fitzgerald.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.771
That's an order!

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.887
Listen!

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.769
There's only a couple hours
of light left.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.047
We got to stash these pelts
and get rid of the boat.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.360
Let's go!

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.999
I told you to be invisible, son.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.319
At least he...

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.319
...If you want to survive,
keep your mouth shut.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.559
- At least he heard me...
- They don't hear your voice!

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.039
They just see the color of your face.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.719
You understand?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.846
Yes.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.079
You have to listen to me, son.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.447
You have to listen.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.005
Beckett!

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.161
Weston!

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.243
Why are
they not jumping?

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.241
It looks
like they changed their minds.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.242
Smart sumbitches.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.251
Smart.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.921
I ought to be
on that boat.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.442
They did the right thing.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.770
It's time to move.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.965
Get up.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.126
We're headed out.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.564
I'm coming.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.442
It's better you lay down.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.519
When the rest of the men are ready
you send them to me.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.488
I'm going west.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.802
You are my son.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.085
There are only two here.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.164
Powaqa is not here.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.039
The others probably took her.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.883
They went north.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.366
We'll pick up their tracks on the mountain.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.050
Was it
the right decision?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.491
Leaving the boat?

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.007
The Ree own that river.
They would've flanked us.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.041
We stay east of the Grand
through the mountains,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.770
we cut a week off our trip.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.889
Lands are bone dry up there.
Nothing for the Ree to hunt.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.325
Except us.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.205
Except us.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.002
Is it true
what Fitzgerald said?

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.205
Is that why you came out
here to the edge of the world?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.161
Glass?

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.083
I do like the quiet.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.531
Your boy...

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.524
...he's seen a lot.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.044
He got a mother
you need to get him back to?

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.768
Mr. Glass!

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.924
There are cubs here!

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.170
We got cubs here!

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.804
Christ Almighty.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.645
He's down here!

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.489
Keep your eyes open.
There's bears around.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.529
I need your help now!

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.285
Oh, my God.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.249
Get me rags now!

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.005
Give me rags
before he bleeds out. Rags.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.844
Prepare the kit. Bridger!
You hold that.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.284
Easy. Oh, my God.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.646
Got to give him
credit for taking that grizz

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.960
down with him.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.280
He shouldn't have shot.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.362
The place is crawling
with tree niggers.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.801
That's enough!
That's enough!

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.803
We're still
in Ree territory.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.644
He's one of our own men.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.807
Scout a circle around us.
North and west.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.609
Take those two with you.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.489
Bill, Fryman,
you take south and east.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.086
Watch for anyone
that might've heard that shot.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.249
We have to stitch him up.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.324
What about me? Captain?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.890
You just stay here.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.321
Hold it down.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.767
I'm so sorry, Mr. Glass.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.486
Bridger,
press down here.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.084
He's bleeding
down here, too.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.807
They're torturing the bastard.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.723
The proper thing to do
would be...

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.929
...to finish him off quick.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.931
Unless he has a chance
of pulling through.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.564
Pulling through?

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.882
You saw what that
grizz did to him.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.048
He'll be dead inside an hour.
Mmm-hmm.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.927
Yeah, we all will be
if he don't quit wailing like that.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.002
Toward you and twist it
into place. I'll hold him. Go.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.844
- Pa.
- Hold him. Go.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.127
Go!

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.686
Now!

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.410
He passed out.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.925
I'll take advantage
and stitch up his neck.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.127
Water.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.961
Bridger, tell the others

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.286
we'll camp here tonight.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.727
I'm right here.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.883
I'll be right here...

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.924
Toussaint, he's here.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.046
I thought he wouldn't make it.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.764
I'm glad you made it here.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.130
We need horses and rifles.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.842
We bring you many pelts.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.483
No horses... just what we agreed.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.527
Take all the pelts you want.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.810
We need horses and rifles.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.124
I need a woman with big tits...

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.884
Who can cook.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.841
We can't give you any horses.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.041
What's he saying?

00:32:23.042 --> 00:32:24.882
I don't know, something about horses.

00:32:24.883 --> 00:32:27.008
Bring us something to drink... some whisky.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.681
Tell him to stop asking about the horses.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.525
Always good doing business with you.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.365
Horses.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.041
No horses.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.929
All we can trade are guns and ammunition.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.441
Tell him if he asks about horses again,
there is no deal.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.243
Where did you get these? The Americans?

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.405
They're already branded.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.726
I'll only be able to get
half price for them.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.768
Get him away from there.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.370
I said no horses.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.128
We'll take these three horses.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.970
I'm not going to say it again.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.682
They aren't part of the deal.

00:33:06.683 --> 00:33:08.364
Now tell your man to step away.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.290
We had an agreement, you have to honor it.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:17.091
<i>In French</i>
You stand there and talk to me about honor?

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.404
I told you he speaks French.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.002
Those pelts are stolen.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.761
You all have stolen everything from us.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.650
Everything!

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.365
The land.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.808
The animals.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.406
Two white men snuck into our village,
and took my daughter, Powaqa.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.766
We leave you these pelts
because honor demands it.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.999
I take your horses to find my daughter.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.800
You are free to try and stop me.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.002
Business is business.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.962
Prepare five horses for them.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.724
I want everybody up
at the crack of dawn.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.562
Carrying Glass will be hard...

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.724
...so we need to get ahead
as far as possible.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.563
We'll divide into two groups.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.651
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.087
you take the east side
of the river.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.561
Anderson, you scout up front.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.001
That claw
don't belong to you.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.170
It ain't for me.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.565
Stop!

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.247
Don't let him down!
Don't let him down!

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.131
Watch it.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.926
How we gonna
make it up this?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.126
Slow down.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.811
It's killing us, Captain!

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.603
Lift it, Bridger!

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.363
Goddamn it,
keep it steady.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.487
Lift it up higher.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.607
I am.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.965
And heave!

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.362
I'll go up and pull.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.769
My foot!

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.524
Enough of this shit!

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.291
We'll never make it across
like this, Captain.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.324
He's burning up.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.329
Cap'n, you ain't doing us
nor him no favors...

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.846
...by letting him
go on suffering like this.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.165
Captain, it's all
the same up here.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.722
We're gonna have to go back.
Find another way.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.401
Glass. Hugh.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.927
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.921
Lay that rag over his eyes,
Mr. Bridger.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.201
What?

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.486
Lay the rag
over his eyes.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.686
Wait!

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.921
I'm sorry, Hugh.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.764
Sir, I can't do that.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.280
How do we
get back without him?

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.964
Only he knows the way.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.041
Lay the rag
over his eyes.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.167
I can't.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.770
Wait! How do
we get back...

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.603
Lay it over his eyes!

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.610
Step back.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.366
Bridger, stop!
Bridger, Henry.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.283
Henry! Henry, please.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.285
Captain. Captain.
Please. Please leave...

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.965
There's a $70 bonus

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.884
from the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company to the two men...

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.201
...that stay with Glass
to see this through.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.406
I'll stay!

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.642
Me, too.
Money or not, I'll stay.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.325
I'll need a third.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.801
Sorry, Captain.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.168
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.724
Captain, three men
can't hold off a party of Ree,

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.643
much less some boys.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.083
Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy
nobody a new set of ears.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.730
A hundred, then.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.561
This man is the only reason
we're still alive.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.927
We were 45 men
when this started.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.082
Now we're ten. Almost nine.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.323
He's my father.
He can have my share.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.926
Mine, too.
He can have my share also.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.920
All right.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.204
If Mr. Bridger
feels the same way,

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.611
I'll lag behind with them.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.920
You?
Yep.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.002
You already lost
my share of the pelts...

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.889
...so I got no choice
but to make it up

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.530
by some other means.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.490
Sticking around
for another day or two

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.130
don't make no difference.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.680
$300... at least I get to
go home with something.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.684
Glass is to be cared
for until, understood?

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.691
Yeah. You have my word.
I understand.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.691
You boys get him
down off this slope

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.683
and somewhere safe
before dark.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.371
Fitzgerald.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.366
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.643
And a proper burial
when it's time.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.881
He's earned it.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.131
I understand.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.890
You hurt yourself?

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.051
I'll be fine.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.971
Can you hear that wind, father?

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:05.284
Remember what mother used to say
about the wind?

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.805
The wind cannot defeat
a tree with strong roots.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.684
You are still breathing...

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.729
I miss her so much.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.931
I will be right here...

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.488
I'm right here.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.920
As long as you can still grab a breath,
you fight.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.800
<i>You breathe. Keep breathing.</i>

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.842
<i>When there is a storm...</i>

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.481
<i>And you stand in front of a tree...</i>

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:32.529
<i>If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.</i>

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:50.240
<i>But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.</i>

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.725
<i>Three hundred bucks</i>

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.404
<i>goes a long way
toward retirement.</i>

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.291
<i>Go down to Texas, find me
a decent piece of land,</i>

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.249
<i>and start pissing in the wind.</i>

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.403
Get me the hell out of this
godforsaken place.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.404
Ree done that to you?

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.651
I'm just asking.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.324
Yeah, they done it.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.491
They took their
sweet time with it.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.960
At the start,
I didn't feel nothing.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.764
I just heard the sound...

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.243
...of the knife scraping
against my skull and...

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.965
...them all laughing
and whooping

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.088
and hollering and whatnot.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.930
Then the blood came.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.005
It was cold. It started
streaming down my face,

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.605
in my eyes, and...

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.604
...breathing it in.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.764
Choking on it.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.922
That's when I felt it.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.602
Yeah, felt all of it.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.760
I got my head
turned inside out.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.886
Jesus.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.962
Them Indians
down Texas way...

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.124
...they may rob you,
but they ain't gonna take your topknot.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.885
When was it?

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.610
Goddamn it,

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.968
will you quit that noise now,
will you?

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.486
Quit it.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.604
<i>I'm falling further back</i>

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.251
<i>from Henry and the boys
on account of tending to you.</i>

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.920
Got to get up
the damn mountain,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.321
but winter
keeps chasing us down.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.528
If you ready
to take the sacrament...

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.682
...I can do that for you.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.922
What you holding to, Glass?

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.681
You know...

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.283
...it would be better...

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.569
...if you were to take that
last breath of yours now...

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.130
for all of us.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.523
Now you hung tough.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.450
And that's something.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.885
I'm begging you.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.167
Them Ree are so close
I can smell 'em.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.561
You can smell 'em, too.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.041
You got to think of your boy.
All right?

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.724
'Cause you're gonna kill him.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.122
You'll kill us all.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.327
I can muzzle you
if you like.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.323
Take away this suffering
quick and easy.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.404
No one ever has to know
that you give up.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.643
All you have to do is blink
if you want me to do that.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.161
Save your boy and blink.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.241
You just have to blink.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.607
Yeah. There it is.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.525
You'd best hope
the good Lord'll

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.602
get His ass here
quick, huh?

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.841
Maybe He'll forgive your sins,
maybe not.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.048
Thus I do commend thee
to the Lord.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.969
Through Jesus Christ the Lord
of all reality and mercy...

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.728
...and the Father
and the Creator, I hold thee...

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.041
Get away! Get away!

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.647
You okay?
Jim! Jim! Help!

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.807
Help!

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.211
Calm down.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.129
Jim! Help!

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.891
Don't shout! You're gonna
get us all killed!

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.361
Keep away! I'll tell
the Captain what you did.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.965
They'll hang you!

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.481
They'll hang you! Jim, help!

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.642
We have an understanding.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.402
What's fucking wrong
with you people?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.331
Shit.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.242
I got one beaver, Hawk.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.730
Breathing changed?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.243
I hadn't noticed.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.403
Damn, he's cold as ice.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.082
Here you go, Mr. Glass.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.925
This will help you.
Keep you warm.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.251
It's all right.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.605
Where's Hawk?

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.524
He ain't with you?

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.841
No.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.251
No?

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.362
I understand, Mr. Glass.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.444
It's all right.
I think I'll get a fire going.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.286
Yeah.
Sounds like a good idea.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.771
Hawk!

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.451
<i>Hawk!</i>

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.730
Shh. Ree.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.724
There's about 20 of them
down by the creek.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.646
They're headed this way.
Grab your shit and let's go.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.926
Shit. What do we do?

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.729
Run, right now.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.001
What about Hawk?

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.003
He ain't our problem no more.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.491
We can't just leave him.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.244
Either he's gutted or scalped.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.766
And if he ain't
he can find us, can't he?

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.683
What about Glass?

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.127
He ain't our problem.
Like us, he's on his own.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.806
We made a promise
to the Captain.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.530
A proper burial
when the time was needed.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.523
He needs that rifle!

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.924
He couldn't do nothing with it
if you tarred it to his hand.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.764
We can't do this.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.524
We got no fucking choice.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.523
No, we can't.
Look at him.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.047
All right, shit, then, buddy.
Get him up.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.451
You want to take him?

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.690
Come on now!

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.804
Easy. Slowly, Fitz.
Easy with him.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.850
Just get your shit.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.365
Get your shit!

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.531
Shut up.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.805
Shut up!

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.566
Hold up!

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.562
Fitz. What are you doing?

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.369
What does it look like?

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.727
Proper burial.
Like you wanted.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.643
No, not like this.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.881
Why not?

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.411
He's alive, Fitz.
He's alive.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.891
So shoot him.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.842
I have to go.
I have to go.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.241
I'm sorry, Mr. Glass.
I'm sorry.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.602
Captain! This way!

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.126
There's a path down here!

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.603
There ain't shit down there!

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.125
We got to climb over!

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.645
Glass said to stay east!

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.121
Glass can go to hell!

00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.371
What's the map say?

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.807
Keep climbing.
We climb, Captain.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.530
We keep climbing.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.449
Till we reach Old Gabe.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.971
We climb.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.805
We got to wait for Murph.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.804
Yeah.
You wait for him.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.971
Captain?

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.246
Sir...

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.687
...Murphy says
there's a way down there.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.250
Who we following?

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.810
You follow who you want!

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.405
I'm going up!

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.005
Stubby, keep going up!

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.321
Murph! Come here!

00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.410
I'm not leaving you, son.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.966
I'm right here.

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.445
Fire's done.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.442
I can't even feel my feet.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.524
Didn't we put enough distance
between us and them Ree?

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.649
A dozen Ree can make
twice as good time as we can.

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.484
Twenty.
What?

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.284
You said you saw
twenty Ree.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.601
Yeah? What you
talking about?

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.370
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.881
You said you saw
twenty Ree by the creek.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.962
Well, yeah,
twenty, a dozen...

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.121
...it don't matter.

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.807
I wasn't gonna hang around
counting fucking feathers.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.211
As a matter of fact...

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.725
...what was you doing down
by the creek all by yourself?

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.767
I'd already brought up
plenty of water.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.726
Hey!

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.246
Answer me, Fitzgerald.
I asked you a question.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.530
Don't question me
on account of you feel guilty.

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.887
Answer me
or I'll blow your head off.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.122
You got
a short-term memory, boy.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.921
Your ass would be floating
around the Missouri right now

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.650
if it wasn't for me.

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.642
You want to ask questions?

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.081
What you want to ask?
If you want to know, ask it.

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.566
Hmm?

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.971
You want to know
why you left

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.208
Mr. Glass back there
for dead, huh?

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.568
Or why you left your little
boyfriend running around?

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.484
You want to know
if he's still alive?

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.002
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't a man yet.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.328
It's 'cause you was
scared shitless.

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.845
You're scared now.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.285
The Ree.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.691
What of them?

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.443
Tell me, did you see 'em?

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.682
Put your rifle down.
Did you see the Ree?

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.120
No.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.203
Not a single one.

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:03.361
You fucking lied to me?
You lied to me!

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.726
I had to scare
some sense into you, boy.

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.202
Glass was dead.
Hawk we don't know about.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.211
No point in either of us
dying either, you understand?

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.688
The way I see it,
I saved your life twice now.

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.888
I ought to be God to you.

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.723
And God giveth...
and God taketh away.

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.525
Lucky fucker.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.208
Next time you want to
shoot somebody...

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.123
...you might
want to use powder,

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.770
prime your rifle.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.401
Come on. Let's git.
Grab your shit.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.690
Fresh blood. This could be Powaqa.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.726
A dead boy.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.449
A Pawnee boy.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.205
Let's go.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.485
Who did this?

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.562
I don't know.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.803
Could be
Captain Leavenworth's boys.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.489
Mmm. Yeah.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.246
Put some eyes on the back
of your head.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.642
These Injuns ain't never
as dead as you think they are.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.561
Look at 'em, huh?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.086
They're always
stealing our shit.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.522
We got horses over here!

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.210
Hey, Bridger.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.290
We got horses!

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.122
What you want to do
about these pigs?

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.406
The Lord's on our side, kid.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.324
You all right there, kid?

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.563
Your head in the right place?

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.571
I guess.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.331
I can't help thinking about
whether we did the right...

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.921
Ain't our place to wonder.
The good Lord...

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.243
...got us on a road
whether we choose it or not.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.763
My pop, he weren't
a religious man, you know?

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.002
If you couldn't grow it,
kill it, or eat it,

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.004
he just plain old
didn't believe in it.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.208
And this one time he head on
up the old Saba hills.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.845
San Saba hills?

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.206
He joined a couple Texas
Ranger buddies of his to hunt.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:59.683
Pretty routine. He done it
like a hundred times before.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.770
Should have been a 3-day kill,
but on the second day,

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.729
it all went fucked.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.441
Somehow that night
he lost his buddies.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.210
And to top it off...

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.040
...them Comanches
went and took the horses.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.280
So he was starving
and delirious...

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.201
...and he crawls up
into this mott, this...

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.801
...group of trees out
in the middle of nowhere

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.486
just sticking up
in this ocean of scrub...

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.882
...and he found religion.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.565
At that moment,
he told me...

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.723
...he found God.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.926
Uh-huh.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.768
And it turns out that God...

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.490
...He's a squirrel.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.245
Yeah. A big, old meaty one.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.446
"I found God,"
he used to say.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:58.524
"And while sitting there
and basking in the glory

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.523
"and sublimity of mercy..."

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.685
shot and ate
that son of a bitch."

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.126
Mmm.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.443
Yeah. You might want to
close your eyes, kid.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.163
I'm injured.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.889
What happened to you?

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.649
A bear.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.489
A bear.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.130
Grizzly.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.845
Grizzly.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.846
My men... left me for dead.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.326
Killed my son.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:53.366
I lost my family too.

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.371
Sioux killed my people.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:04.483
I'm going south to find more Pawnee.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.287
My heart bleeds...

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.685
But revenge is in the creator's hands.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.204
You will ride with me...

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.083
Your body is rotten.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.450
Need to heal.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.485
You could die.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.164
Yeah!
There she is.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.011
We did it.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.480
You ought to be
proud of yourself, boy.

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.447
Yeah.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.760
We followed orders.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.002
We just skipped
the funeral part.

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.802
Don't go clown there
and start growing no conscience.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.081
'Cause sure
as night'll come

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.766
they'll have us swinging
from a couple ropes.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.525
We did
what we had to do.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.521
<i>We had the extra day
so we managed to dig.</i>

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.365
...a little deeper,
lay rocks on top

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.010
so scavengers
couldn't get at him.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.369
It was done right and all.
He was buried right.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:04.960
Sir, can we...

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.246
The truth is that...

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.724
...when Hawk disappeared,
I was worried about savages.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.209
And I was ready to get,
to move on out.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:18.406
Yeah, but, Bridger here
argued to stay.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.368
He argued to stay...

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.444
...so he could at least
build a cross or something...

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.484
...to put on top
of Glass's grave,

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.564
and that's what he did.
That's what we did.

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.120
I'm glad you pulled
your weight, Mr. Bridger.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.850
He more than
pulled his weight, Captain.

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.321
This man here,
he was my partner.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.371
Am I to assume that the agreed
arrangement did not change?

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.330
Uh, fortunately for me,
it did not.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.965
Mmm-hmm.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.770
Thank you...

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.125
...for your courage,
honor, and service.

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.725
Deal or no deal,
Mr. Bridger,

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.121
you deserve something
for what you did.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.805
Thank you.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.687
Kid's been beating himself up
awful bad the whole trip.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.202
We all saw
the shape Glass was in.

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.806
There was no more
to be done. Right?

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.167
Yeah.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.161
We all saw him.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:22.323
<i>When there is a storm...</i>

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:29.084
<i>And you stand in front of a tree...</i>

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:36.566
<i>If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.</i>

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:50.320
<i>But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.</i>

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.611
There are traces of a camp...

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.169
There are traces of a camp...

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.208
Where?

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.563
Entering the moon forest.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.925
Maybe from two days ago.
They are moving east.

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.644
Tell the others.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.767
Let's move quickly,
Powaqa could be with them!

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.762
Bring me the girl...

01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.881
Those five horses weren't for free.

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.444
Shh...

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:26.803
Don't make a sound.

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:44.482
I will get a horse.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:52.162
I'll cut off your balls.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:10.530
Where is Toussaint?

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.287
Come here...

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.443
- May I join you?
- Yes.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:09.681
Yeah?

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.801
Yes.

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:14.726
I was wondering when we might
be getting paid for that haul.

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.485
'Cause them pelts
we collected

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.284
are still out there,
you know...

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.964
...under a couple foot
of dirt and snow.

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.691
But that ain't
my fault.

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.330
I'm waiting for
Captain Leavenworth

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:27.124
to arrive
with his army.

01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.487
Then we'll have
enough men...

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:32.291
...to shoot some civilization
into those fucking Arikara

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.044
and get back
our pelts.

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.248
All right. All right.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.247
When's that supposed to happen?

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.891
I don't know.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:43.402
But until then,
nobody gets paid.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.722
Listen here, all right?

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:51.721
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.449
The way I see it,
now you, you got a safe.

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.409
It's probably full of money.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.290
You signed a contract
to protect your boss

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.601
and your boss's property.

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:05.571
And that safe
isn't full anymore.

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.927
It's short about $300.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.921
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.163
It means,
according to my records...

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.169
...you purchased more goods
on the expedition

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.601
than what you are
owed by the company.

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.602
Now, Happy New Year,
Fitzgerald.

01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:33.889
Fryman!
White man at the gate!

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.805
Speak English.

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.168
I have no weapon.

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.969
Open her up!

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.485
Get the Captain!

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:54.607
<i>Where are your men?</i>

01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:57.006
All dead.

01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:58.366
Who was he?

01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:01.486
I don't know.
Something to eat, please?

01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.130
Food comes at a price.

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.651
I have no money.

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.245
Then you don't eat.

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.085
Give back some of them stolen
pelts you buy from the Injuns.

01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.650
Not now, Jones.
Huh?

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.722
Silver.
How is this? Silver.

01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:18.251
This all you got?

01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:22.322
We was nine.

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:25.160
My friend, he die
in the snow.

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:27.482
And the other was...

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.842
...kill by wolf. I see it.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.322
By wolf, yeah, kill.

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:34.250
Where'd you get this?

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:36.171
Canteen.

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:39.171
He drop it.
He kill Toussaint, he drop it...

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.486
Who? Who?

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.688
I don't know.
I don't see.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:45.647
It could be Hawk.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:49.931
Yeah, could be.

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:52.122
That half-breed runt
couldn't steal no horse.

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.960
- Maybe it was Weston.
- Or Beckett.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.365
How far from here?

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.771
Thirty mile.

01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:58.484
Northwest,
near the Yellowstone.

01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.971
The Yellowstone!

01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.725
Get the horses saddled.
Torches and supplies.

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:04.529
Ten dollars a man.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:06.204
Anderson, you stay here.

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.170
Yes, sir.
Feed him and watch him.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.010
I'll get you a drink.

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.201
When we get to
the Yellowstone,

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.448
we split into two groups!

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.211
Hawk!

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.442
Hawk, you out there?

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.202
Whoa! Whoa!

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.124
Keep your guard up!

01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.405
Eyes in front!

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.485
Who are you?

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.563
Beckett? Is that you?

01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.526
Glass?

01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:38.807
Glass!

01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:41.124
Jesus Christ!

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.089
Jesus Christ,
what happened?

01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:45.364
Where is he?

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:50.521
Jones, take him. Go.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.844
I'm riding ahead.
Bill, take Bridger.

01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:56.365
Take Bridger!

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:11.521
Have you seen Fitzgerald?

02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:12.971
No, sir.

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:20.962
Get up. Get up!

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:22.804
You seen Fitzgerald?
No, sir.

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.041
Fitzgerald?

02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:36.690
Whoa, easy.
Where did he go?

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:40.406
Who?
Fitzgerald. Where did he go?

02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:41.721
I have no idea.

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.290
Tell me or I'll take
your head off.

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.328
I swear to God...

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:47.323
Tell me. Tell me!

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:48.731
Texas!

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.089
He said he was going to Texas.
He said he was gonna reenlist.

02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.605
Then he started
talking about property.

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:56.603
"A decent
piece of land."

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:59.206
He's heading for Texas.
That's all I know.

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.645
Stay here.

02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:05.250
Fitzgerald!

02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.284
Fitzgerald!

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:38.290
Goddamn it!

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:42.644
Goddamn it!

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.204
Jones! Get the Captain!

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.486
Fryman!

02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:48.721
Open the gate!

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.325
Open it up!

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.730
Murphy,
get the Captain.

02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:02.731
Get him to the doctor. Now!

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:07.561
You said he was dead!
You said he was dead!

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.721
I thought
he was, I swear!

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.005
He lied to me!

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.491
You're a liar.

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:16.131
You left him out there!

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.924
Say the Lord's Prayer.

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:21.163
Say the Lord's Prayer!

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:27.003
- Our Father, Who art in heaven.
- Who art... I can't!

02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.844
Shut up! Shut up!

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.844
From here out,
you're a prisoner charged with treason!

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:34.571
Take him to the cage!
Take him to the cage

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:36.529
or you'll hang alongside him!

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.762
I thought he was gonna die!

02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:41.929
Fitz lied to me!

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.280
I couldn't help him!

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.611
Glass!

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:51.409
Fitz lied to me!

02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:22.881
How is he?

02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:24.405
He'll be fine,
but there is swelling.

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.811
He needs to rest.

02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:28.008
I'll be back
to check up on him.

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:39.561
He ran off,
didn't he?

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.527
Bridger's telling the truth.

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:53.691
How's that?

02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:58.001
Fitzgerald lied to him.
He was just following orders.

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:02.885
He wasn't there when
Fitzgerald stabbed my boy to death.

02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:09.530
Is that what happened?

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:13.285
He killed Hawk.

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:18.964
I need a horse and gun.

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:22.408
No, you need to rest and eat.
I'm going after him.

02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.766
No.

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:26.804
You'll never find him
without me.

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.805
If we wait till morning
he'll get away.

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:31.484
No, he won't.

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.483
He's afraid.

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:38.484
He knows how far
I came for him.

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:40.721
Same as that elk.

02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.247
When they get afraid,
they run deep into the woods.

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:48.691
I got him trapped.
He just doesn't know it yet.

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:50.923
How can you be so sure?

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:54.564
'Cause he has
everything to lose.

02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:59.166
All I had was that boy.

02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:02.482
And he took him away from me.

02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:08.241
I can't let you
go back out there.

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.924
Not again.

02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:15.845
I ain't afraid
to die anymore.

02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:19.449
I done it already.

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:27.123
I'm going with you.

02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:44.328
That's his horse,
all right.

02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:49.730
No way he could've ridden him
through the night.

02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:51.529
How far ahead?

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:54.122
Half a day at the most.

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.204
Could be Ree.

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.607
If they aren't his,
we lose him.

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:02.966
Unless he reenlisted
so he could justify killing again...

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.282
...these tracks
right here are his.

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:18.120
<i>I can't remember
my wife's face.</i>

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:21.486
<i>Last week,
she was still with me.</i>

02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:24.804
<i>Now she's gone.</i>

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:31.168
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:45.641
Is it true
you killed an officer?

02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:53.688
I just killed the man
who was trying to kill my son.

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.771
Smoke.

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.451
How close?

02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:23.361
No more than
a mile up that way.

02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:26.888
I'm gonna head up to the west.
You go down to the east.

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.601
Let's see if we can
find some tracks.

02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.289
And if it's the Ree?

02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:35.201
If it's the Ree,
you turn right back around

02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:37.123
and meet me back here.

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:07.804
Now, I wouldn't expect
to find a man of your stature...

02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.645
...so far away
from his stove

02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:11.404
on a morning
as cold as this, Captain.

02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:12.811
You lost?

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:15.486
I'm here to take you back
to Fort Kiowa...

02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:17.962
...where you
will be tried for murder.

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:19.651
Is that so?

02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.167
I ain't crazy
about your plan.

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:24.642
Besides, I got
one of my own.

02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:55.845
We had a deal, Glass!

02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:01.400
I tried to tell your boy,
all right?

02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:04.450
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen

02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:06.204
and he kept on screaming.

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.806
He was gonna get
everybody killed.

02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:13.410
But you and me...
we had a deal.

02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:17.727
You know what
happened out there.

02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.169
And on my soul,
the Lord... He knows...

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:23.083
...what happened out there.

02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:27.564
There was no deal.

02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.369
You killed my boy.

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:38.242
Well, maybe you should've
raised a man,

02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:40.089
instead of some
girlie little bitch.

02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:53.763
Goddamn it.

02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:20.806
You came all this way
just for your revenge, huh?

02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.561
Well, you enjoy it, Glass.

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:29.370
'Cause there ain't nothing
gonna bring your boy back.

02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:34.004
No, it won't.

02:21:55.560 --> 02:22:00.566
Revenge is in God's hands...

02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:03.486
...not mine.
