00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:04.320
I heard nothing about the
one question that matters,

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:09.054
which is why did Cora Tannetti
kill Frankie Belmont?

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:13.127
- I don't know.
- I know what you're doing,

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:14.262
so you can just stop.

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:15.548
What am I doing?

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:16.829
You're trying to get rid of me,

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.938
and then you're just gonna
go meet up with him anyway.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.805
You want me to die.

00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:24.813
You know I'd be lost
without you, dead already.

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.324
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.793
You're the only reason
that this is worth it.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.864
This Saturday, meet me at the
Taproom, just come home with me,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
and you don't go back.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.803
I can't breathe. My heart.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.705
You're okay. Everything's okay.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.175
I want to go home.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.144
What's that?

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.180
That's it.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.517
It happened down there.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.488
Are you coming?

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:21.178
I remember now.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.726
Come on.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.664
Yeah.

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:11.086
So what did you wish for?

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:15.866
Great wealth and a miraculous
abundance of cleavage.

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.536
19, and every year a miracle.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.309
I almost let you go.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:30.514
The doctors, they told me
to say goodbye, but I couldn't.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.883
I would not.

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:37.288
So I asked for help,
and then you opened your eyes,

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.256
and you looked right into mine,

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:43.452
and I felt this strength
rush through me.

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.274
You should drink wine more often, Mom,

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.864
not just on my birthday.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.032
It suits you.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.569
Thank you.

00:03:05.243 --> 00:03:07.618
That's an indulgent gift, Cora.

00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:08.819
My.

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:12.327
It's perfect for the beach.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.725
I guess I won't be
getting there, will I?

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.727
- Phoebs.
- Don't say that.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.540
One more round, and then
you're back on your feet.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.532
I've never really been on my feet, Dad.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.707
Everything will be fine,

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:26.670
because you are a miracle.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.393
Do you have plans tonight, dear sister?

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:36.244
No, of course not.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.916
It's your birthday.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:02.573
You're such a liar.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:04.274
I told him I'd meet him.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.610
He has my phone. I mean, I can't not go.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.200
Then take me with you.

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:15.020
Come on. It's my birthday.

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:18.355
I'm 19. I'm still celebrating
with Mom and Dad and the cake

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.048
that she's been making me
since I was four.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.626
I can't take it anymore.

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.995
- Phoebe...
- Come on.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.764
There's no way you can go to a bar.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.699
We go for an hour,

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:30.567
and then you take me home.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.636
Please?

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:35.005
Phoebs, you can't.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.433
You know you can't.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.809
You know.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.894
I'll start screaming and wake them up.

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:45.918
I swear.

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:15.846
God, this is crazy.

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:19.450
I can do it. Just let me.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.443
Are you not entertained?

00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:49.556
Come on.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.979
There's so much.

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.014
Sit here.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.947
- Are you all right?
- No.

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:30.153
No, I desperately need a Manhattan.

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.105
All right, I will get you some water,

00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:37.427
and if it's okay,
I'm just gonna say hey to JD.

00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:41.079
No, no, no. Just stay for a little bit.

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:43.967
Okay.

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:54.878
Would you be Lacey of the sisters Lacey?

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.649
You're JD.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.058
JD, this is my sister Phoebe.

00:07:04.412 --> 00:07:05.945
This is him?

00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:08.125
So she's mentioned me.

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:10.928
She didn't mention that
you drank like an old lady.

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:14.062
The sea breeze is misunderstood.

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.319
Hi.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.570
Hi.

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:23.394
Hi.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.042
No? Sorry.

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:30.745
JD, I'm done. Can we go?

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:33.850
Yeah, we're just waiting
on these shots right here.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:39.589
Is that his girlfriend too?

00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:41.355
No, she's an ex.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:42.793
Who are you?

00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:44.700
This is my sister Phoebe.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.564
What is it, teen night?

00:07:56.842 --> 00:07:59.610
- What is it?
- Some molly and some other stuff.

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:02.613
You took one?

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:05.616
Well, we all did about half an hour ago.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.818
Well, we can't.

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:10.087
You definitely can't.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.123
Yeah, it's really intense.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.995
Phoebe, what are you doing?

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:21.030
That could kill you.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:25.569
Too late now.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.767
Yeah, so anyway... it broke.

00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:50.401
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:08:53.177 --> 00:08:57.880
Do you know about
JD's girlfriend before me?

00:08:57.915 --> 00:08:59.852
No.

00:09:03.712 --> 00:09:08.457
I just thought
you should know, this girl,

00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:11.808
she said she was on the pill,
and she wasn't,

00:09:12.163 --> 00:09:14.644
and she got pregnant,

00:09:15.633 --> 00:09:17.967
and she got all excited.

00:09:18.002 --> 00:09:22.957
She wanted to name
the baby Winter, but JD,

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:26.082
he didn't want to be a father,
and he was like,

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:30.046
"You lied. You're crazy.
Leave me out of this."

00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:32.059
And the girl freaked.

00:09:32.598 --> 00:09:35.215
She walked out into traffic.

00:09:36.317 --> 00:09:38.317
The baby died.

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:42.540
I don't really care
what happened before me.

00:09:42.575 --> 00:09:44.113
Listen.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.449
I'm trying to help you.

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:50.955
Whatever you want from him...
a husband, a family,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.084
a nice little house...
he's not gonna give it to you.

00:10:13.272 --> 00:10:15.573
What happened to you?

00:10:15.608 --> 00:10:19.261
Something happened,
'cause you're so sad.

00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:22.884
No, I'm not.

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:27.418
Yeah, I can see it.
It's... it's all around you.

00:10:32.325 --> 00:10:34.167
I'm really sorry.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.578
Okay, come on. Let's sit down.

00:10:54.614 --> 00:10:57.147
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yep.

00:10:57.183 --> 00:10:58.749
Yes, yeah.

00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:16.184
So...

00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:20.471
About JD...

00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:22.254
- Don't.
- No, listen.

00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:24.217
Listen.

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:28.446
You are waiting for him to ride up

00:11:28.784 --> 00:11:30.798
and choose you.

00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:35.800
That's not your game.

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:38.667
Because you're a giant.

00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:45.105
You could... you could pluck up
anybody you wanted.

00:11:45.765 --> 00:11:49.013
You could have anything you wanted.

00:11:50.497 --> 00:11:52.330
Do you even know that?

00:11:56.842 --> 00:12:00.660
You are so high.

00:12:03.749 --> 00:12:05.649
Yeah.

00:12:14.493 --> 00:12:16.894
It's time to go. Lights out.

00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:25.209
Come on.

00:12:25.303 --> 00:12:27.271
Come on, we got to go. Let's go.
Let's go.

00:12:27.306 --> 00:12:28.405
No, why?

00:12:31.544 --> 00:12:33.740
- I'm not going home.
- Yes, you are.

00:12:33.765 --> 00:12:35.457
You've had enough,
and you're gonna hurt yourself.

00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:37.681
I'm calling a cab.

00:12:37.717 --> 00:12:39.781
I'm fine, and I know what you're doing,

00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:41.318
so you can just stop.

00:12:41.354 --> 00:12:42.820
What am I doing?

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:44.466
You're trying to get rid of me,

00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:47.358
and then you're just gonna go
and meet up with him anyway.

00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:50.260
- You can't handle this.
- What do you care?

00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:52.863
You want me to die anyway.

00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:55.532
Shut up.

00:12:57.303 --> 00:12:59.470
It's true. Admit it.

00:13:05.878 --> 00:13:07.678
Jeez, you're a mess.

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:09.279
Let's get you in the car.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.548
Sorry. She just invited herself,

00:13:11.584 --> 00:13:14.370
and she wouldn't let it go.

00:13:14.587 --> 00:13:15.953
It doesn't matter.

00:13:17.723 --> 00:13:20.221
After tonight, you're free, right?

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:22.326
Yeah.

00:13:35.237 --> 00:13:36.306
Come on.

00:14:11.126 --> 00:14:13.326
When are you gonna
tell me how to...

00:14:13.364 --> 00:14:15.030
Why?

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.589
I mean, I've seen it at the house.

00:14:17.676 --> 00:14:19.909
It messes with the energy.

00:14:20.102 --> 00:14:21.916
I screwed up.

00:14:22.137 --> 00:14:24.018
What?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.439
I had an accident.
I peed myself.

00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:36.216
We have to pull over for a sec.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.385
- Why?
- What do you mean?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.587
Just... just pull over, JD, please.

00:14:40.622 --> 00:14:43.523
Is somebody gonna puke?
Please don't.

00:14:43.558 --> 00:14:45.292
Please. We'll be fast.

00:14:58.844 --> 00:15:01.010
I can't... I can't...
I can't breathe.

00:15:01.046 --> 00:15:02.745
- My heart.
- Just relax.

00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:05.072
- I can't... I can't...
- Well, just stop moving.

00:15:05.097 --> 00:15:06.115
- My heart. It...
- Okay.

00:15:06.151 --> 00:15:07.784
- The pill. The...
- Everything's okay.

00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:09.614
- No, no, the pill, they poisoned me.
- No, you're just peaking.

00:15:09.638 --> 00:15:11.387
- They poisoned...
- You're just peaking.

00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:13.723
Breathe. Look at me.

00:15:13.758 --> 00:15:14.991
Breathe.

00:15:18.363 --> 00:15:20.964
I want to go home.

00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:24.624
We can't just ask everybody
to turn around now.

00:15:27.138 --> 00:15:29.873
Wait, just let me get my bag.

00:15:34.618 --> 00:15:38.345
Where are we?
We didn't even think about that.

00:15:38.503 --> 00:15:39.969
Think, dude.

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:51.961
Cora.

00:15:55.926 --> 00:15:56.992
Cora?

00:15:58.536 --> 00:16:00.087
Cora.

00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:08.278
Cora! Cora!

00:16:11.816 --> 00:16:14.083
Cora! Where...

00:16:28.867 --> 00:16:31.267
Why do you have all
that stuff in your bag?

00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:32.502
Because.

00:16:34.272 --> 00:16:38.408
- Get this going.
- Cora!

00:16:38.443 --> 00:16:40.009
Were you gonna spend
the night with him

00:16:40.045 --> 00:16:42.024
and not tell me?

00:16:42.614 --> 00:16:44.438
Were you?

00:16:45.221 --> 00:16:48.062
He asked me to move
in with him, okay?

00:16:48.853 --> 00:16:50.887
And I said yes.

00:16:53.258 --> 00:16:55.091
- What?
- We were supposed to go home

00:16:55.126 --> 00:16:56.734
after the bar.

00:16:57.929 --> 00:16:59.162
Just always push it.

00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:05.969
I'm not letting you
ruin this for me.

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:08.871
Then, what? You were just...

00:17:08.907 --> 00:17:11.207
you were just gonna leave
and be gone for good?

00:17:20.352 --> 00:17:21.851
Come on!

00:17:23.555 --> 00:17:25.837
Come on.

00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:27.457
Come on!

00:17:28.626 --> 00:17:30.093
Whoo!

00:17:30.128 --> 00:17:32.829
All right, that's enough.

00:17:49.481 --> 00:17:52.615
- That's dope.
- My God.

00:17:57.156 --> 00:17:58.287
We're going around back.

00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:01.304
There she is.

00:18:02.127 --> 00:18:04.391
Maddie, you're looking delicious.

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:05.992
- Come on, girl.
- Show us what you got.

00:18:06.017 --> 00:18:07.296
- Show us some moves.
- Stop it.

00:18:07.332 --> 00:18:09.098
Ooh!

00:18:09.134 --> 00:18:10.933
You know how to pick a lock?

00:18:16.174 --> 00:18:17.673
- Ooh!
- Give me the flashlight.

00:18:17.709 --> 00:18:19.320
I'll trade you the bottle
for the flashlight.

00:18:19.344 --> 00:18:22.271
- All right, fair trade.
- Look at this.

00:18:22.647 --> 00:18:25.185
What took you guys so long?

00:18:25.483 --> 00:18:27.517
- Hey.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

00:18:27.542 --> 00:18:29.052
Mr. Frankie Belmont.

00:18:29.095 --> 00:18:30.478
- Whoohoohoo!
- All right, man.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.856
What is this place?

00:18:34.943 --> 00:18:36.753
The Beverwyck Club,

00:18:37.214 --> 00:18:39.558
a bastion of the WASP empire.

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:41.232
I'd live here.

00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:44.639
I'm fine. Can we just go?

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:47.265
We're gonna hang out
for a few minutes.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.202
Then I'm gonna ask JD
if I can borrow his truck,

00:18:49.227 --> 00:18:50.526
and I'm gonna drive you home.

00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:54.128
Medical student
Frankie Belmont was found dead

00:18:54.153 --> 00:18:56.332
at the age of 23

00:18:56.367 --> 00:19:00.706
after a tragic bannister
accident at the Beverwyck Club.

00:19:00.731 --> 00:19:03.296
People said that had been
squatting there

00:19:03.321 --> 00:19:04.776
for the past two days.

00:19:07.078 --> 00:19:08.878
You all right?

00:19:08.913 --> 00:19:11.585
He leaves behind a prestigious
scholarship in LA

00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:15.180
as well as some humiliating
footage of a panic attack

00:19:15.234 --> 00:19:19.156
he had on the Jetway at...

00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:21.738
This is in lieu of that
panic attack, little dude.

00:19:21.774 --> 00:19:24.775
- That's such tender love.
- I'll drink to that.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.362
Whoo!

00:19:30.616 --> 00:19:33.517
You in the back, I love you.

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.533
All right, time for the tour.

00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:48.451
What's that? What's in there?
Let's go check this out.

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.687
My God, you gotta see this room.

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:54.043
Vick! Vick! Look at this room.

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.676
Help me upstairs.

00:19:56.885 --> 00:20:00.793
- And this is the trophy...
- Looks like a fetish box to me.

00:20:02.567 --> 00:20:06.536
Hey. Um, I'm Frankie.

00:20:08.183 --> 00:20:10.136
I'm Phoebe.

00:20:11.535 --> 00:20:14.870
I want to show you something.

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:19.172
So you're Cora's, um, sister, yeah?

00:20:19.265 --> 00:20:23.265
No, no, no. I'm actually
her sober companion.

00:20:23.343 --> 00:20:28.658
I'm just really bad at my job,
so she's probably gonna fire me.

00:20:28.693 --> 00:20:32.958
Presenting the woman's parlor.

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:34.697
So I'd assume that this

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.433
is the club's version
of the menstruation hut.

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:38.603
Yes.

00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:41.111
You got to keep them contained
during the witchy time.

00:20:41.136 --> 00:20:43.473
Can't have the bad mojo
affecting the deer hunting.

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:44.808
Or, you know, the backgammon.

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:47.577
I mean, this is serious man business.

00:20:47.612 --> 00:20:48.650
Yeah.

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:53.383
Eat rocks and...

00:20:58.557 --> 00:21:00.619
Come downstairs with me.

00:21:00.725 --> 00:21:02.376
I got a good friend
down there I'm trying to go

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.424
into business with.

00:21:03.449 --> 00:21:05.877
I need you to help me impress him.

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:08.298
- I can do that.
- Yeah?

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.833
You're my front man?

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:12.090
All right.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:22.104
I saw you leaning up against
your sister earlier.

00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:24.581
Would you believe me if I told you

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:27.120
that I just have a really bad knee?

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.184
Are you okay?

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.856
Well, let's see.

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:37.660
I'm a virgin with Swiss cheese
for a heart

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:41.757
and a touch of nonHodgkin's lymphoma...

00:21:42.102 --> 00:21:43.943
under the influence of ecstasy.

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:47.668
Well, I see how it is. Okay.

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:52.408
Well, I'm a med student good boy
looking for his balls

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:54.545
at the bottom of a bottle.

00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:56.741
Yeah, well,

00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:00.415
life's too short to be good,

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:04.254
said the dying girl
who has barely lived.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:05.755
You are so not dying.

00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:13.284
So what else do you have on your
todo list for your life?

00:22:13.393 --> 00:22:17.276
- Sex, obviously.
- Obviously, but what else?

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.437
I want to get, like, rock hard abs.

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:23.506
Just like...

00:22:23.803 --> 00:22:25.850
go for an eightpack.

00:22:26.077 --> 00:22:27.951
'Sup?

00:22:28.713 --> 00:22:32.303
Todd, this is Cora.

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:34.550
Hello.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.170
You do things in style, JD,
I'll give you that.

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:43.273
Hi. I'm Todd. How are you tonight?

00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:46.362
I'm well. How are you?

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.433
There's a few of us
hanging out down the hall.

00:22:50.468 --> 00:22:53.336
It's a bit of a party,
like I told you.

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:55.214
Well, that sounds good.

00:22:55.674 --> 00:22:57.331
Sounds really good.

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:59.417
Todd's a real estate developer.

00:22:59.442 --> 00:23:02.393
He and I have been talking about
working on a project together.

00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:04.781
What kind of a project?

00:23:05.059 --> 00:23:07.871
This your first time here?

00:23:08.409 --> 00:23:10.753
Yeah, I grew up around here.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:14.426
I never knew this place even existed.

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:18.176
It's a nice little oasis to escape to

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:20.430
if you've been working too hard.

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:28.705
How... how do you two know
each other, again?

00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:36.696
"And then those little
anodynes that deaden suffering."

00:23:36.721 --> 00:23:40.415
Nothing starts
a party like Emily Dickinson.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.720
Well, I have decided
to get out more than she did.

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.888
Yeah? Where to?

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.757
Anywhere.

00:23:47.792 --> 00:23:49.125
Doesn't matter.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.661
Because that is actually my destiny:

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:54.464
To be the host of a travel show.

00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:58.466
Okay, I'm in.
I will be your assistant.

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:00.903
Well, I do have very poor circulation,

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:02.364
so you're going to have
to massage my feet.

00:24:02.388 --> 00:24:04.810
It would be my honor to do so.

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:14.124
I feel like I've always known you.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.036
I just... I look at you, and...

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.677
it just feels right.

00:24:24.929 --> 00:24:29.432
- Don't... don't say that.
- It's true.

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.474
Hey, Phoebe.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.713
Hey. Come on.

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:46.172
Hey. Come back. Phoebe.

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:49.952
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't... don't apologize.

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.919
Is this okay?

00:25:32.735 --> 00:25:35.103
I bring jars to my neighbors.
They swear by it

00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:38.151
for all their ailments.

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:41.440
Couple of them stopped
going to the doctor.

00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:45.174
They just wait too long
and beg me for it.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.616
I hate these.

00:25:51.515 --> 00:25:54.539
We should go
and see the hives by the house.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.786
And if the bees sting you,
that's just more antigens.

00:26:00.712 --> 00:26:02.945
Once you learn how
to move with the bees,

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.236
it's a beautiful thing.

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:22.393
Todd, hi.

00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:25.548
- Maddie.
- You guys look so bored.

00:26:25.573 --> 00:26:26.921
What's the matter?

00:26:26.956 --> 00:26:29.590
It's not the right time, Maddie.

00:26:29.626 --> 00:26:33.594
Time for what? Todd's here.
It must be something bad.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.430
Do you remember last summer I performed?

00:26:36.466 --> 00:26:39.500
- Maddie...
- That was so fun, right?

00:26:39.535 --> 00:26:40.832
You remember that?

00:26:40.857 --> 00:26:43.491
Maddie, you need to leave.

00:26:45.675 --> 00:26:46.863
Why?

00:26:46.888 --> 00:26:49.823
'Cause I'm tired of you
hanging around all the time.

00:26:50.513 --> 00:26:52.046
Why don't you go home?

00:26:58.186 --> 00:26:59.652
Can't go home. I don't have a car.

00:26:59.722 --> 00:27:01.622
Well, figure it out.

00:27:03.793 --> 00:27:05.459
Do you hear me?

00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:10.464
Do you hear me?

00:27:18.675 --> 00:27:20.857
What am I doing wrong?

00:27:21.644 --> 00:27:24.579
I have done everything
that you have asked of me.

00:27:24.614 --> 00:27:28.249
Everything. More than her.

00:27:30.133 --> 00:27:31.319
You know.

00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:33.963
You know.

00:27:33.988 --> 00:27:37.023
Maddie, getting pregnant
doesn't make you matter.

00:27:37.483 --> 00:27:39.116
You understand?

00:27:39.143 --> 00:27:41.310
Neither does jumping in front of a car.

00:27:43.666 --> 00:27:45.783
Now go home.

00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:01.248
I should find my sister.

00:28:01.273 --> 00:28:02.783
- I need to...
- Hey.

00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:05.853
Hey, hey, Cora. Come sit down, please.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.154
Don't be rude to our friend.

00:28:10.228 --> 00:28:13.670
I should find... I have to go.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.507
Cora.

00:28:16.633 --> 00:28:18.349
Cora!

00:28:20.637 --> 00:28:22.303
Phoebe?

00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:26.374
Phoebe?

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.694
Phoebe?

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.881
Phoebe?

00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:04.279
What are you doing?

00:29:23.766 --> 00:29:26.291
Wa... Wait.

00:30:02.189 --> 00:30:06.595
<i>Honey, where have you been?</i>

00:30:08.811 --> 00:30:11.187
<i>Is you twotimin' me?</i>

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.477
<i>How come you didn't show up?</i>

00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:47.701
Hey.

00:30:49.405 --> 00:30:51.905
This night had plans for us.

00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:54.095
Look at him.

00:30:57.313 --> 00:30:59.501
Look, I'm ready to go.

00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:01.715
Where's JD?

00:31:05.454 --> 00:31:07.220
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

00:31:07.256 --> 00:31:10.590
Whatever it is, it's...
it's gonna be okay.

00:31:11.218 --> 00:31:13.434
I just want to go.

00:31:15.864 --> 00:31:17.949
I'm not going home

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.035
to that house, to that bed.

00:31:23.439 --> 00:31:26.924
This is what's left here for me.

00:31:28.877 --> 00:31:30.477
What does that mean?

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.603
I know...

00:31:44.927 --> 00:31:48.051
how much you've given up for me...

00:31:49.064 --> 00:31:52.098
over these years, and...

00:31:53.702 --> 00:31:55.653
and I'm sorry.

00:31:55.904 --> 00:31:59.693
I'm sorry, because I let you do
it, and...

00:32:00.776 --> 00:32:04.311
you have to... you have to think
about yourself.

00:32:04.346 --> 00:32:06.959
You have to take care of yourself, okay?

00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:08.782
Okay, promise me.

00:32:12.021 --> 00:32:13.854
Why are you saying this?

00:32:15.758 --> 00:32:17.904
'Cause I love you.

00:32:18.664 --> 00:32:21.799
Then please, please,
please, let's go.

00:32:21.897 --> 00:32:25.732
All right,
so this is where the party went.

00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:32.708
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

00:32:32.941 --> 00:32:36.911
Hey, did you guys know that
today is my birthday?

00:32:37.513 --> 00:32:40.601
What? Are you serious?

00:32:41.683 --> 00:32:46.152
And we are going downstairs
to listen to your music.

00:32:47.022 --> 00:32:48.155
Okay.

00:32:54.288 --> 00:32:57.631
All right, like, just give me a second.
I'll go stretch, okay?

00:32:57.877 --> 00:33:00.453
Yeah, play that song
you worked on last night.

00:33:09.282 --> 00:33:13.455
Cora, are you coming?

00:33:34.459 --> 00:33:36.355
I mean, the mix still has a ways to go,

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.482
but it's getting there.

00:33:38.513 --> 00:33:40.105
- No, I love it.
- Yeah?

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.531
Yeah.

00:33:41.566 --> 00:33:44.200
Forget saving lives.
Just make people dance.

00:33:44.235 --> 00:33:45.635
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.513
So this is you, all of it?

00:33:47.538 --> 00:33:49.144
I mean, I did the drum programming,

00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:50.373
and, you know, the synths.

00:33:50.408 --> 00:33:51.541
JD did the vocals.

00:33:51.576 --> 00:33:53.688
So he's the voice.

00:33:53.812 --> 00:33:57.727
JD, we have an emergency.

00:33:57.916 --> 00:34:01.451
There's a damsel drowning
in selfcontrol.

00:34:01.704 --> 00:34:03.486
She is, isn't she?

00:34:03.813 --> 00:34:05.719
She needs help.

00:34:05.799 --> 00:34:07.799
Give her a hit.
It'll loosen her up.

00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:10.572
- I don't want any.
- No.

00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:12.252
You deserve to feel good.

00:34:14.595 --> 00:34:15.653
Come here.

00:34:19.961 --> 00:34:22.458
Let yourself go...

00:34:22.904 --> 00:34:24.740
for once.

00:34:32.292 --> 00:34:34.525
Just have this little one.

00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:06.629
Now, Frankie's turn.

00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:09.393
It's just us. It's good.

00:35:51.137 --> 00:35:52.370
Your turn.

00:35:55.508 --> 00:35:57.975
You're the giant.

00:36:49.462 --> 00:36:52.797
I have a bad heart.
It's not pretty.

00:36:52.832 --> 00:36:54.832
Your heart doesn't matter.

00:37:23.897 --> 00:37:28.532
Well, there's nothing bad
about this heart.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.106
Do you want it?

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.810
Yes.

00:38:12.845 --> 00:38:14.909
You have to say it.

00:38:15.045 --> 00:38:16.745
I want it.

00:38:18.818 --> 00:38:20.518
Why do you deserve that?

00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:24.726
I don't.

00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:26.123
No, you don't.

00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:07.794
Breathe!

00:39:15.554 --> 00:39:19.823
Stop it! Get off her! Get off!

00:39:20.046 --> 00:39:22.146
Stop it!

00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:25.049
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stop! Stop! Stop her!

00:39:25.084 --> 00:39:26.951
Stop it! She's not breathing, okay?

00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:28.303
- Stop!
- Stop!
