Your personal healthcare companion.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.580

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.102

how would you rate your pain?

abrasion on your forearm.

I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.185
What's in the spray, specifically?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.300
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.540
(CLICKS TONGUE) That's a bummer.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.946

You are not allergic to bacitracin.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.348
You do have a mild allergy to

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.540

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.310
Hmm. Not bad.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.940
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.144
Uh-huh. Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.827
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

Where did you get those?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.540
Oh, machined them right here, in-house.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.980
- Really?
- Yup.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.620

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.861
Lithium ion.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.706
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.066
Huh.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.500

his career in bot-fighting.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.740
Well, kind of serious.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.900
I can see why.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.068
With your bot, winning must come easy.

then my program isn't for you.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.944
and that's what we're gonna do.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.660
Who are we?

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.028
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.380
They say, "We are what we are"

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.580
But we don't have to be

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.020
I'm bad behavior

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.144
But I do it in the best way

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.260
I'll be the watcher

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.500
Of the eternal flame

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.780
I'll be the guard dog

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.062
Of all your fever dreams

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:26.380
I am the sand in the bottom
half of the hourglass

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.945
Glass

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.060
I try to picture me
without you but I can't

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.025
'Cause we could be immortals

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.100
Immortals

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.620
Just not for long
For long

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.980
Live with me forever now

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.060
Pull the blackout curtains down

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:51.460
Just not for long

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.100
For long

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:58.420
We could be immortals
Immortals

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:03.620
Immortals

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.142
Immortals

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.100
Sometimes the only payoff

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.260
For having any faith

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.340
Is when it's tested again

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.660
And again
Every day

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.980
I'm still comparing your past

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.784
To my future

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:34.190
It might be open but they're not sutured

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.148
I am the sand in the bottom
half of the hour glass

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:50.827
I try to picture me without
you but I can't

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.707
'Cause we could be
Immortals

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.584
Immortals

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.340
Just not for long
For long

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.460
Live with me forever now

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.504
We pull the blackout curtains down

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:08.780
Just not for long
For long

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.060
We could be immortals
Immortals

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:18.709
Immortals

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.300
Immortals

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.221
And live with me forever now

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:28.340
And pull the blackout curtains down

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.985
Down

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.700
We could be immortals
Immortals

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.700
Just not for long
For long

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:45.220
We could be immortals
Immortals

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:49.823
Immortals

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:55.220
Immortals

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.420
Dad, I just wish I could share
my accomplishments with you.

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.429
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.901
I've always felt a distance

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.349
what with you being
on the family island all the time,

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.710
and I just wish you could see how...

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:52.101
MAN: Fred.

01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.941
Son.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:01.906
Dad?

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:08.301
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.580
BOTH: I go inside out,
then I go front and back.

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:14.986
Dad!

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.269
We have a lot to talk about.
